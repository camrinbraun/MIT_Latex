Transcripts from the transcriptomes of \textit{T. rotula} and \textit{Skeletonema} spp. were clustered based upon relative homology with available diatom genomes: \textit{F. cylindrus}, \textit{P. tricornitum}, \textit{P. multiseries}, and \textit{T. pseudonana}. Symbols indicate different species, while color indicates regulation in the field incubation experiments. Two nodes within a gene cluster are connected by an edge if they share a homologous protein (reciprocal BLAST hit with a minimum of 1e-5 score and minimum 20\% identity). Gene clusters are visualized using an edge-weighted spring-embedded model based on e-value, meaning that genes that are closer together are more similar. The width of the line correlates to the magnitude of the e-value, with lower e-values represented by thicker lines and higher e-values represented by thinner lines.}

The value of C was varied over 10 different values and the average percentages of genes falling into each of the quadrants is depicted above based on the size of the circle at the median $STD_N$ and $STD_P$ for the genes in the quadrant. Similarity of data between species by quadrant was assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a generalized linear model. The results from a post hoc Tukey test show the divergence of species across time ($p < 0.05$).}
