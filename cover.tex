% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

You don't get to see this yet.  
%Throughout graduate school I have been supported by the MIT Presdidential Fellowship, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, the Ocean Life Institute Fellowship, and the WHOI Academic Progams Office. 
%This thesis, like so many of my achievements and adventures to date, would not have come to fruition without the support, help, and care of the many incredible people in my life. 
%First and foremost, I want thank my advisor, Sonya Dyhrman. Over the last five years, Sonya has nurtured my scientific curiosity, while challenging me to delve deeper and work harder than I knew I could. [Something about how we travel and have fun?] It has been a great privalage to work with such a brilliant scientist whose integrity and devotion to science and her colleuges I hope to emulate in my career. 
%I am also grateful to my thesis committee, Penny Chisholm, Scott Doney, Mick Follows, and Bethany Jenkins, for all their guidance and thoughtful input during this process. I especially wish to thank my co-advisor, Elizabeth Kujawinski, who generously folded me into her lab group following Sonya's relocation. Additionally, I would like to thank my co-authors: Tatiana Rynearson, Mak Saito, Dave Karl, Sam Wilson. 
%I am so happy to have intersected with such wonderful people during my time in the Dyhrman lab group. Sheean Haley, it goes without saying that you are the glue that holds us all together and the XX that keeps the lab running seamlessly. Your leavity and indefatigability both on land and at sea have kept me grounded and made all my science possible. To my fellow graduate students and postdocs, Louie Wurch, Abby Heithoff, Monica Rouco, Solange Duhmel, and Kyle Frishkorn, thank you for showing me the way and being awesome. I also wish to thank all my WHOI and non-WHOI friends for helping me find and maintain balance in my life. Thanks especially to Isabela Le Bras for all your support over the last few years. 

%Finally, I would like to thank my mother and family for their tireless love and support not only during my Ph.D., but throughout my life. In particular, I wish to dedicate this thesis to the memory of my grandparents Betty and Sherwood Finley. I owe my work ethic, love of nature, and XX to them.
