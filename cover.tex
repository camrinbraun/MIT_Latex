\section*{\centerline{\LARGE\textsc{Acknowledgments}}}

This thesis, like so many of my adventures to date, would not have come to fruition without the support, help, and care of the many incredible people in my life. \par
First and foremost, I must thank my advisor, Sonya Dyhrman. Over the last five years, Sonya has nurtured my scientific curiosity, while simultaneously challenging me to delve deeper and work harder than I knew I could. She also went well beyond many advisors waking before dawn to help with harvests and traveling to the \textit{literal} ends of the earth to make science happen. It has been a great privilege to work with such a talented scientist, whose integrity and devotion to science and her colleagues I hope to emulate in my career. \par
I am also grateful to my thesis committee, Penny Chisholm, Scott Doney, Mick Follows, and Bethany Jenkins, for  their guidance and thoughtful input during this process. I especially wish to thank my co-advisor, Elizabeth Kujawinski, who generously folded me into her lab group following Sonya's relocation. Additionally, I would like to thank my co-authors on some of these chapters: Tatiana Rynearson, Mak Saito, Dave Karl, and Sam Wilson. \par
I am happy to have overlapped with a group of wonderful and supportive people during my time in the Dyhrman lab group. Sheean Haley, it goes without saying that you are the engine that keeps the lab running seamlessly. Your levity, indefatigably, and upper body strength, both on land and at sea, kept me grounded during my thesis and made all my science possible. To my fellow Dyhrman Lab graduate students and postdocs, Louie, Abby, Monica, Solange, Colleen, and Kyle, thank you for your camaraderie, help, and general awesomeness. \par
The Woods Hole community has  ***I also wish to thank all my WHOI and non-WHOI friends for helping me find and maintain balance in my life. Thanks especially to Isabela Le Bras for all your support over the last few years.\par 
Finally, I would like to thank my mother and family for their tireless love and support not only during my Ph.D., but throughout my life. I wish to dedicate this thesis to the memory of my grandparents Betty and Sherwood Finley, to whom I owe my work ethic, love of nature, and creativity.\par 
Throughout graduate school I have been supported by the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, the Ocean Life Institute Fellowship, and the WHOI Academic Programs Office.
