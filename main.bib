abstract = {Marine primary productivity is iron (Fe)-limited in vast regions of the contemporary oceans, most notably the high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. Diatoms often form large blooms upon the relief of Fe limitation in HNLC regions despite their prebloom low cell density. Although Fe plays an important role in controlling diatom distribution, the mechanisms of Fe uptake and adaptation to low iron availability are largely unknown. Through a combination of nontargeted transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, we have explored the biochemical strategies preferred by Phaeo dactylum tricornutum at growth-limiting levels of dissolved Fe. Processes carried out by components rich in Fe, such as photosynthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, and nitrate assimilation, were down-regulated. Our results show that this retrenchment is compensated by nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) reallocation from protein and carbohydrate degradation, adaptations to chlorophyll biosynthesis and pigment metabolism, removal of excess electrons by mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and augmented Fe-independent oxidative stress responses. Iron limitation leads to the elevated expression of at least three gene clusters absent from the Thalassiosira pseudonana genome that encode for components of iron capture and uptake mechanisms.},

abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

         of AtTPS1 in Arabidopsis using the 35S promoter led to a small increase in trehalose and trehalose-6-P levels. In spite of this, transgenic plants displayed a dehydration
         tolerance phenotype without any visible morphological alterations, except for delayed flowering. Moreover, seedlings overexpressing
         AtTPS1 exhibited glucose (Glc)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive phenotypes. Transgenic seedlings germinated on Glc were visibly
         larger with green well-expanded cotyledonary leaves and fully developed roots, in contrast with wild-type seedlings showing
         growth retardation and absence of photosynthetic tissue. An ABA dose-response experiment revealed a higher germination rate
         for transgenic plants overexpressing AtTPS1 showing insensitive germination kinetics at 2.5 ÂµM ABA. Interestingly, germination in the presence of Glc did not trigger an increase in ABA content in plants overexpressing
         AtTPS1. Expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in transgenic plants showed up-regulation of the ABI4 and CAB1 genes. In the presence of Glc, CAB1 expression remained high, whereas ABI4, HXK1, and ApL3 levels were down-regulated in the AtTPS1-overexpressing lines. Analysis of AtTPS1 expression in HXK1-antisense or HXK1-sense transgenic lines suggests the possible involvement of AtTPS1 in the hexokinase-dependent Glc-signaling pathway. These

abstract = {Diatoms are photoautotrophic organisms capable of growing on a variety of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources. Discovery of a complete urea cycle in diatoms was surprising, as this pathway commonly functions in heterotrophic organisms to rid cells of waste nitrogen. To determine how the urea cycle is integrated into cellular nitrogen metabolism and energy management, the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was maintained in semi-continuous batch cultures on nitrate, ammonium, or urea as the sole nitrogen source, under a 16: 8 light: dark cycle and at light intensities that were low, saturating, or high for growth. Steady-state transcript levels were determined for genes encoding enzymes linked to the urea cycle, urea hydrolysis, glutamine synthesis, pyrimidine synthesis, photorespiration, and energy storage. Transcript abundances were significantly affected by nitrogen source, light intensity and a diel cycle. The impact of N source on differential transcript accumulation was most apparent under the highest light intensity. Models of cellular metabolism under high light were developed based on changes in transcript abundance and predicted enzyme localizations. We hypothesize that the urea cycle is integrated into nitrogen metabolism through its connection to glutamine and in the eventual production of urea. These findings have important implications for nitrogen flow in the cell over diel cycles at surface ocean irradiances.},

abstract = {Brown tides of the marine pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens Hargraves et Sieburth have been investigated extensively for the past two decades. Its growth is fueled by a variety of nitrogen (N) compounds, with dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) being particularly important during blooms. Characterization of a cDNA library suggests that A. anophagefferens can assimilate eight different forms of N. Expression of genes related to the sensing, uptake, and assimilation of inorganic and organic N, as well as the catabolic process of autophagy, was assayed in cells grown on different N sources and in N-limited cells. Growth on nitrate elicited an increase in the relative expression of nitrate and ammonium transporters, a nutrient stress-induced transporter, and a sensory kinase. Growth on urea increased the relative expression of a urea and a formate/nitrite transporter, while growth on ammonium resulted in an increase in the relative expression of an ammonium transporter, a novel ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and a putative high-affinity phosphate transporter. N limitation resulted in a 30- to 110-fold increase in the relative expression of nitrate, ammonium, urea, amino acid/polyamine, and formate/nitrite transporters. A. anophagefferens demonstrated the highest relative accumulation of a transcript encoding a novel purine transporter, which was highly expressed across all N sources. This finding suggests that purines are an important source of N for the growth of this organism and could possibly contribute to the initiation and maintenance of blooms in the natural environment.},

abstract = {The availability and composition of dissolved nitrogen in ocean waters are factors that influence species composition in natural phytoplankton communities. The same factors affect the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon incorporation in calcifying species, such as the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Lohman) W. W. Hay et H. Mohler. E. huxleyi has been shown to thrive on various nitrogen sources, including dissolved organic nitrogen. Nevertheless, assimilation of dissolved nitrogen under nitrogen-replete and -limited conditions is not well understood in this ecologically important species. In this study, the complete amino acid sequences for three functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in E. huxleyi were identified: a putative formamidase, a glutamine synthetase (GSII family), and assimilatory nitrate reductase. Expression patterns of the three enzymes in cells grown on inorganic as well as organic nitrogen sources indicated reduced expression levels of nitrate reductase when cells were grown on NH4+ and a reduced expression level of the putative formamidase when growth was on NO3â. The data reported here suggest the presence of a nitrogen preference hierarchy in E. huxleyi. In addition, the gene encoding for a phosphate repressible phosphate permease was more highly expressed in cells growing on formamide than in cells growing on inorganic nitrogen sources. This finding suggests a coupling between phosphate and nitrogen metabolism, which might give this species a competitive advantage in nutrient-depleted environments. The potential of using expression of genes investigated here as indicators of specific nitrogen-metabolism strategies of E. huxleyi in natural populations of phytoplankton is discussed.},

@article{Caldwell2005,
abstract = {Summary
Background: In Drosophila, each of the three larval instars ends with a molt, triggered by release of steroid molting hormone ecdysone from the prothoracic gland (PG). Because all growth occurs during the larval stages, final body size depends on both the larval growth rate and the duration of each larval stage, which in turn might be regulated by the timing of ecdysone release.

Results: Here, we show that the expression of activated Ras, PI3 kinase (PI3K), or Raf specifically in the PG reduces body size, whereas activated Ras or PI3K, but not Raf, increases PG cell size. In contrast, expression of either dominant-negative (dn) Ras, Raf, or PI3K increases body size and prolongs the larval stages, leading to delayed pupariation, whereas expression of dn-PI3K, but not of dn-Raf or dn-Ras, reduces PG cell size. To test the possibility that altered ecdysone release is responsible for these phenotypes, we measured larval ecdysone levels indirectly, via the transcriptional activation of two ecdysone targets, E74A and E74B. We found that the activation of Ras within the PG induces precocious ecdysone release, whereas expression of either dn-PI3K or dn-Raf in the PG greatly attenuates the [ecdysone] increase that causes growth cessation and pupariation onset.

Conclusions: We conclude that Ras activity in the PG regulates body size and the duration of each larval stage by regulating ecdysone release. We also suggest that ecdysone release is regulated in two ways: a PI3K-dependent growth-promoting effect on PG cells, and a Raf-dependent step that may involve the transcriptional regulation of ecdysone biosynthetic genes.},

We found relative expression levels for a collection of 127 transcripts and calculated the percentage of cDNA libraries that had expression levels (for a given transcript) within 2-fold through 10-fold ranges. When all libraries were considered together, the highest ranked housekeeping controls included transcripts for a DanJ-like protein, translationally controlled tumor protein, two alpha-tubulins, cyclophilin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). For each organ (leaf, root, fruit, and flower), at least one transcript was found that occurred within a 2-fold range of expression in all respective libraries. These included transcripts for alpha-tubulin, DnaJ-like proteins, phosphoglycerate kinase, and GAPDH, although different transcripts appear better suited than others for different tissues. This analytical method is useful for identifying candidate housekeeping controls in particular tissues and at particular levels of expression and would be relevant for any species for which significant EST data exist.},

An exceptionally large set of data from Affymetrix ATH1 whole-genome GeneChip studies provided the means to identify a new generation of reference genes with very stable expression levels in the model plant species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Hundreds of Arabidopsis genes were found that outperform traditional reference genes in terms of expression stability throughout development and under a range of environmental conditions. Most of these were expressed at much lower levels than traditional reference genes, making them very suitable for normalization of gene expression over a wide range of transcript levels. Specific and efficient primers were developed for 22 genes and tested on a diverse set of 20 cDNA samples. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed superior expression stability and lower absolute expression levels for many of these genes, including genes encoding a protein phosphatase 2A subunit, a coatomer subunit, and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The developed PCR primers or hybridization probes for the novel reference genes will enable better normalization and quantification of transcript levels in Arabidopsis in the future.},

abstract = {Utilizing a PCR-based subtractive cDNA approach, we demonstrated that the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana exhibits a rapid response at the gene level to elevated concentrations of copper and that this response attenuates over 24 h of continuous exposure. A total of 16 copper-induced genes were identified, 11 of which were completely novel; however, many of the predicted amino acid sequences had characteristics suggestive of roles in ameliorating copper toxicity. Most of the novel genes were not equivalently induced by H2O2- or Cd-induced stress, indicating specificity in response. Two genes that could be assigned functions based on homology were also induced under conditions of general cellular stress. Half of the identified genes were located within two inverted repeats in the genome, and novel genes in one inverted repeat had mRNA levels induced by â¼500- to 2,000-fold by exposure to copper for 1 h. Additionally, some of the inverted repeat genes demonstrated a dose-dependent response to Cu, but not Cd, and appear to belong to a multigene family. This multigene family may be the diatom functional homolog of metallothioneins.},

abstract = {We report the characterization of a cell-surface protein isolated from copper-stressed cells of the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana Hasle and Heimdal (CCMP 1335). This protein has an apparent molecular weight of 100\&\#xa0;kDa and is highly acidic. The 100\&\#xa0;kDa protein (p100) sequence is comprised almost entirely of a novel domain termed TpRCR for T. pseudonana repetitive cysteine-rich domain, that is repeated 8 times and that contains conserved aromatic, acidic, and potential metal-binding amino acids. The analysis of the T. pseudonana genome suggests that p100 belongs to a large family of modular proteins that consist of a variable number of TpRCR domain repeats. Based on cell surface biotinylation and antibody data, p100 appears to migrate more rapidly with SDSâPAGE when extracted from cells exposed to high levels of copper; however, the discovery of a large family of TpRCR domain-containing proteins leaves open the possibility that the antibody may be cross-reacting with members of this protein family that are responding differently to copper. The response of the gene encoding p100 at the mRNA level during synchronized progression through the normal cell cycle is similar to previously characterized genes in T. pseudonana encoding cell wall proteins called silaffins.},

abstract = {For accurate and reliable gene expression analysis, normalization of gene expression data against housekeeping genes (reference or internal control genes) is required. It is known that commonly used housekeeping genes (e.g. ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, and B2M) vary considerably under different experimental conditions and therefore their use for normalization is limited. We performed a meta-analysis of 13,629 human gene array samples in order to identify the most stable expressed genes. Here we show novel candidate housekeeping genes (e.g. RPS13, RPL27, RPS20 and OAZ1) with enhanced stability among a multitude of different cell types and varying experimental conditions. None of the commonly used housekeeping genes were present in the top 50 of the most stable expressed genes. In addition, using 2,543 diverse mouse gene array samples we were able to confirm the enhanced stability of the candidate novel housekeeping genes in another mammalian species. Therefore, the identified novel candidate housekeeping genes seem to be the most appropriate choice for normalizing gene expression data.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a critical driver of phytoplankton growth and ecosystem function in the ocean. Diatoms are an abundant class of marine phytoplankton that are responsible for significant amounts of primary production. With the control they exert on the oceanic carbon cycle, there have been a number of studies focused on how diatoms respond to limiting macro and micronutrients such as iron and nitrogen. However, diatom physiological responses to P deficiency are poorly understood. Here, we couple deep sequencing of transcript tags and quantitative proteomics to analyze the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown under P-replete and P-deficient conditions. A total of 318 transcripts were differentially regulated with a false discovery rate of <0.05, and a total of 136 proteins were differentially abundant (p<0.05). Significant changes in the abundance of transcripts and proteins were observed and coordinated for multiple biochemical pathways, including glycolysis and translation. Patterns in transcript and protein abundance were also linked to physiological changes in cellular P distributions, and enzyme activities. These data demonstrate that diatom P deficiency results in changes in cellular P allocation through polyphosphate production, increased P transport, a switch to utilization of dissolved organic P through increased production of metalloenzymes, and a remodeling of the cell surface through production of sulfolipids. Together, these findings reveal that T. pseudonana has evolved a sophisticated response to P deficiency involving multiple biochemical strategies that are likely critical to its ability to respond to variations in environmental P availability.},

Signals from the gonad might thus regulate whole-organism aging by modulating IIS. To date, the details of this systemic regulation of aging by the reproductive system are not understood, and it is unknown whether such effects are evolutionarily conserved. Here we report that eliminating germ cells (GCs) in Drosophila melanogaster increases lifespan and modulates insulin signaling. Long-lived germ-line-less flies show increased production of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (dilps) and hypoglycemia but simultaneously exhibit several characteristics of IIS impedance, as indicated by up-regulation of the Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO) target genes 4E-BP and l (2)efl and the insulin/IGF-binding protein IMP-L2. These results suggest that signals from the gonad regulate lifespan and modulate insulin sensitivity in the fly and that the gonadal regulation of aging is evolutionarily conserved.},

We show the self-organized-map approach to be best for both measurement types at higher numbers of clusters.

Here, we evaluated the gene expressions of 10 frequently used HKGs, including 18S rRNA, P2, ACT, TUA, TUB, CYC, eIF4E, MDH, UBQ, and GAPDH, with a total of 17 RNA samples extracted from the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. All the RNAs were prepared from various cells cultured under different conditions, including thermal shocks, toxic chemical exposures, and different life stages. Via C(T) analyses of the 10 HKGs using the geNorm software, TUA was selected as the most stable HKG for gene expression studies of the dinoflagellate, followed by MDH. Pair-wise variation (V) analysis showed that at least 2 genes were required for accurate normalization of gene expression studies depending on the experimental conditions. These HKGs are useful internal controls for the normalization of gene expression in P. minimum.},

abstract = {The centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal and the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin possess genes with translated sequences homologous to high-affinity ferric reductases present in model organisms. Thalassiosira pseudonana also possesses putative genes for membrane-bound ferroxidase (TpFET3) and two highly similar iron (Fe) permeases (TpFTR1 and TpFTR2), as well as a divalent metal (M2+) transporter belonging to the NRAMP superfamily (TpNRAMP). In bakerâs yeast, the ferroxidaseâpermease complex transports Fe(II) produced by reductases. We investigated transcript abundances of these genes as a function of Fe quota (QFe). Ferric reductase transcripts are abundant in both species (15\%â60\% of actin) under low QFe and are down-regulated by 5- to 35-fold at high QFe, suggesting Fe(III) reduction is a common, inducible strategy for Fe acquisition in marine diatoms. Permease transcript abundance was regulated by Fe status in T.Â pseudonana, but we did not detect significant differences in expression of the copper (Cu)-containing ferroxidase. TpNRAMP showed the most dramatic regulation by QFe, suggesting a role in cellular Fe transport in either cell-surface uptake or vacuolar mobilization. We could not identify ferroxidase or permease homologues in the P.Â tricornutum genome. The up-regulation of genes in T.Â pseudonana that appear to be missing altogether from P.Â tricornutum as well as the finding that P.Â tricornutum seems to have an efficient system to acquire Feâ², suggest that diverse (and uncharacterized) Fe-uptake systems may be at play within diatom assemblages. Different uptake systems among diatoms may provide a mechanistic basis for niche differentiation with respect to Fe availability in the ocean.},

These results are a first step in the dissection of the behavior of the dinoflagellate proteome under nitrogen stress conditions and may provide new insights into the relationship between dinoflagellate blooms and the nitrogen budget.

abstract = {Dinoflagellate symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium are integral to the success of the coral holobiont (a coral host and the microbial community it harbours), however despite their importance we currently have a very limited knowledge of the genes which they possess and their genomic organisation. Analysis shows that the number of expressed sequence tags (genes that are expressed) available for Symbiodinium (7964) is less than 1/10 of those available for the scleractinian coral host (103,434). This lack of DNA sequence information limits the functional genomic studies that can be undertaken from the symbiont perspective. In addition these sequences are from only three Symbiodinium types (C3, A1, A3) and do not represent the large diversity of clades and subclades seen. Here we summarise our current understanding of the Symbiodinium genomic content with reference to our knowledge of other dinoflagellates. The genetic information of Symbiodinium is encompassed in the nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genomes. As is the case with other dinoflagellates these three genomes are significantly different from the âgeneralâ phototrophic eukaryote. Firstly the nuclear genome of dinoflagellates is extremely large, utilises modified DNA bases not normally found in eukaryotes, and tandem repeat regions seem to contain the most highly expressed genes. Meanwhile the plastid genome, which normally contains between 40 and 250 genes in other eukaryotes, has been reduced to 18 genes encoded in âminicircles.â Finally the dinoflagellate mitochondrial genome only encodes for 2 or 3 proteins instead of the normal 40â50 in other eukaryotes. While we have some knowledge of Symbiodinium genome structure, little is known about its transcriptome. With the advent of inexpensive high throughput sequencing technologies, our understanding of the Symbiodinium genome will rapidly increase and we will begin to be able to look into the responses of these important single celled organisms.},

abstract = {We analyzed flavodoxin gene sequences and transcription patterns in the marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium Ehrenberg ex Gomont 1892. While a typical cyanobacterial flavodoxin ortholog (fld1) was identified from cultured (strain IMS101) and environmental Trichodesmium by PCR and Southern blot hybridization, a second flavodoxin (fld2) was identified in the genome sequence. BLAST and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the two fld genes were highly divergent: fld1 was most closely related to fld common in cyanobacteria, wheras fld2 formed a distinct cluster with a fld so far only found in the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria Cyanothece and Crocosphaera (in which fld2 was the only fld). The fld2 cluster was more closely allied with a fld in non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs such as Azotobacter and Azoarcus than fld1 in other cyanobacteria. This result suggests different evolutionary history of these two genes. Real-Time RTâPCR analysis on iron-replete and iron-deplete Trichodesmium cultures revealed remarkable diel dynamics in transcription of both flds but surprisingly failed to show induction under iron stress. Addition of nitrate to these cultures depressed nifH and fld2 transcription while elevating the transcription of fld1 in iron-stressed cultures.

Our data suggest that these two flavodoxins in Trichodesmium may be functionally diversified and that use of flavodoxin as an iron stress indicator needs to be validated for each organism with consideration of diel dynamics of gene expression.},

Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2â$\Delta$$\Delta$CT method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2â$\Delta$$\Delta$CT method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2â$\Delta$$\Delta$CT method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.},

abstract = {Even though sequencing of the mammalian genome has led to the discovery of a large number of ionic channel genes, identification of the molecular determinants of cellular electrical properties in different regions of the heart has been rarely obtained. We developed a high-throughput approach capable of simultaneously assessing the expression pattern of ionic channel repertoires from different regions of the mouse heart. By using large-scale real-time RT-PCR, we have profiled 71 channels and related genes in the sinoatrial node (SAN), atrioventricular node (AVN), the atria (A) and ventricles (V). Hearts from 30 adult male C57BL/6 mice were microdissected and RNA was isolated from six pools of five mice each. TaqMan data were analysed using the threshold cycle (Ct) relative quantification method. Cross-contamination of each region was checked with expression of the atrial and ventricular myosin light chains. Two-way hierarchical clustering analysis of the 71 genes successfully classified the six pools from the four distinct regions. In comparison with the A, the SAN and AVN were characterized by higher expression of Nav$\beta$1, Nav$\beta$3, Cav1.3, Cav3.1 and Cav$\alpha$2$\delta$2, and lower expression of Kv4.2, Cx40, Cx43 and Kir3.1. In addition, the SAN was characterized by higher expression of HCN1 and HCN4, and lower expression of RYR2, Kir6.2, Cav$\beta$2 and Cav$\gamma$4. The AVN was characterized by higher expression of Nav1.1, Nav1.7, Kv1.6, Kv$\beta$1, MinK and Cav$\gamma$7. Other gene expression profiles discriminate between the ventricular and the atrial myocardium. The present study provides the first genome-scale regional ionic channel expression profile in the mouse heart.},

abstract = {The prasinophyte order Mamiellales contains several widespread marine picophytoplankton (â¤2 $\mu$m diameter) taxa, including Micromonas and Ostreococcus. Complete genome sequences are available for two Micromonas isolates, CCMP1545 and RCC299. We performed in silico analyses of nitrogen transporters and related assimilation genes in CCMP1545 and RCC299 and compared these with other green lineage organisms as well as Chromalveolata, fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Phylogenetic reconstructions of ammonium transporter (AMT) genes revealed divergent types contained within each Mamiellales genome. Some were affiliated with plant and green algal AMT1 genes and others with bacterial AMT2 genes. Land plant AMT2 genes were phylogenetically closer to archaeal transporters than to Mamiellales AMT2 genes. The Mamiellales represent the first green algal genomes to harbor AMT2 genes, which are not found in Chlorella and Chlamydomonas or the chromalveolate algae analyzed but are present in oomycetes. Fewer nitrate transporter (NRT) than AMT genes were identified in the Mamiellales. NRT1 was found in all but CCMP1545 and showed highest similarity to Mamiellales and proteobacterial NRTs. NRT2 genes formed a bootstrap-supported clade basal to other green lineage organisms. Several nitrogen-related genes were colocated, forming a nitrogen gene cluster. Overall, RCC299 showed the most divergent suite of nitrogen transporters within the various Mamiellales genomes, and we developed TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction primerâprobes targeting a subset of these, as well as housekeeping genes, in RCC299. All those investigated showed expression either under standard growth conditions or under nitrogen depletion. Like other recent publications, our findings show a higher degree of âmixed lineage gene affiliationsâ among eukaryotes than anticipated, and even the most phylogenetically anomalous versions appear to be functional. Nitrogen is often considered a regulating factor for phytoplankton populations. This study provides a springboard for exploring the use and functional diversification of inorganic nitrogen transporters and related genes in eukaryotic phytoplankton.},

Four putative homologs of TWCA1 are also reported and described from a search of the genomic sequence of Thalassiosira pseudonana and designated TWCATp1â4. The $\delta$-CA class is therefore more widely distributed in marine phytoplankton than previously thought. In particular, it is not restricted to the diatoms like the cadmium-containing enzyme, CDCA, seems to be ($\zeta$-CA class). Zinc status strongly influences growth rate in marine diatoms. We observed a decrease in the specific growth rate of T. pseudonana from 2.1 to 1.3Â dayâ1 when the unchelated Zn concentration (Znâ²) was lowered from 20 to 5Â pM. In the same cultures, we detected a drop in whole-cell CA activity of about 50\% in the most Zn-limited cells that occurred simultaneously with a large downregulation of TWCATp1, TWCATp2 and CDCATp gene transcripts and protein. These three genes were also found to be strongly upregulated by low pCO2 in a manner typical of many algal CA enzymes. We have also conducted field experiments in diatom-dominated natural phytoplankton assemblages sampled from Great Bay of the coast of New Jersey. We observed increased total CA activity in parallel with increased expression of homologous twca and cdca gene transcripts in water incubated at increasingly higher pH values. Immunoblot and transcript expression analyses demonstrated a clear upregulation of CDCA transcript and protein as incubation pH increased both in the lab and in the field indicating that this CA is expressed under a broad range of environmental conditions and not restricted to low pCO2 and low Zn.},

abstract = {There is evidence that the CO2-concentrating mechanism in the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii operates as a type of single-cell C4 photosynthesis. In quantitative-PCR assays, we observed 2- to 4-fold up-regulation of two phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene transcripts in Thalassiosira pseudonana cells adapted to low pCO2, but did not detect such regulation in Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown under similar conditions. Transcripts encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase did not appear to be regulated by pCO2 in either diatom. In T. pseudonana and T. weissflogii, net CO2 fixation was blocked by 3,3-dichloro-2-(dihydroxyphosphinoyl-methyl)-propenoate (a specific inhibitor of PEPC), but was restored
         by about 50\% and 80\%, respectively, by addition of millimolar concentrations of KHCO3. In T. pseudonana, T. weissflogii, and P. tricornutum, rates of net O2 evolution were reduced by an average of 67\%, 55\%, and 62\%, respectively, in the presence of 20 ÂµM quercetin, also an inhibitor of PEPC. Quercetin promoted net CO2 leakage from inhibited cells to levels in excess of the equilibrium CO2 concentration, suggesting that a fraction of the HCO3â taken up is fated to leak back into the medium as CO2 when PEPC activity is blocked. In parallel to these experiments, in vitro assays on crude extracts of T. pseudonana demonstrated mean inhibition of 65\% of PEPC activity by quercetin. In the presence of 5 mM 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MPA), a classic inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, photosynthetic O2 evolution was reduced by 90\% in T. pseudonana. In T. weissflogii and P. tricornutum, 5 mM 3-MPA totally inhibited net CO2 fixation and O2 evolution. Neither quercetin nor 3-MPA had a significant inhibitory effect on photosynthetic O2 evolution or CO2 uptake in the marine chlorophyte isolates Chlamydomonas sp. or Dunaliella tertiolecta. Our evidence supports the idea that C4-based CO2-concentrating mechanisms are generally distributed in diatoms. This conclusion is discussed within the context of the evolutionary
         success of diatoms.},

abstract = {Formation of complex inorganic structures is widespread in nature. Diatoms create intricately patterned cell walls of inorganic silicon that are a biomimetic model for design and generation of three-dimensional silica nanostructures. To date, only relatively simple silica structures can be generated in vitro through manipulation of known diatom phosphoproteins (silaffins) and long-chain polyamines. Here, we report the use of genome-wide transcriptome analyses of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to identify additional candidate gene products involved in the biological manipulation of silicon. Whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling arrays and tandem mass spectrometry identified transcripts for >8,000 genes, approximately 3,000 of which were not previously described and included noncoding and antisense RNAs. Gene-specific expression profiles detected a set of 75 genes induced only under low concentrations of silicon but not under low concentrations of nitrogen or iron, alkaline pH, or low temperatures. Most of these induced gene products were predicted to contain secretory signals and/or transmembrane domains but displayed no homology to known proteins. Over half of these genes were newly discovered, identified only through the use of tiling arrays. Unexpectedly, a common set of 84 genes were induced by both silicon and iron limitations, suggesting that biological manipulation of silicon may share pathways in common with iron or, alternatively, that iron may serve as a required cofactor for silicon processes. These results provide insights into the transcriptional and translational basis for the biological generation of elaborate silicon nanostructures by these ecologically important microbes.},

abstract = {The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transcription factor PSR1 is
required for the control of activities involved in scavenging phosphate
from the environment during periods of phosphorus limitation. Increased
scavenging activity reflects the development of high-affinity phosphate
transport and the expression of extracellular phosphatases that can
cleave phosphate from organic compounds in the environment. A
comparison of gene expression patterns using microarray analyses and
quantitative PCRs with wild-type and psr1 mutant cells
deprived of phosphorus has revealed that PSR1 also controls genes
encoding proteins with potential âelectron valveâ
functionsâthese proteins can serve as alternative electron
acceptors that help prevent photodamage caused by overexcitation of the
photosynthetic electron transport system. In accordance with this
finding, phosphorus-starved psr1 mutants die when subjected to
elevated light intensities; at these intensities, the wild-type cells
still exhibit rapid growth. Acclimation to phosphorus deprivation also
involves a reduction in the levels of transcripts encoding proteins
involved in photosynthesis and both cytoplasmic and chloroplast
translation as well as an increase in the levels of transcripts
encoding stress-associated chaperones and proteases. Surprisingly,
phosphorus-deficient psr1 cells (but not wild-type cells) also
display expression patterns associated with specific responses to
sulfur deprivation, suggesting a hitherto unsuspected link between the
signal transduction pathways involved in controlling phosphorus and
sulfur starvation responses. Together, these results demonstrate that
PSR1 is critical for the survival of cells under conditions of
suboptimal phosphorus availability and that it plays a key role in
controlling both scavenging responses and the ability of the cell to
manage excess absorbed excitation

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dinoflagellates are unicellular, often photosynthetic protists that play a major role in the dynamics of the Earth's oceans and climate. Sequencing of dinoflagellate nuclear DNA is thwarted by their massive genome sizes that are often several times that in humans. However, modern transcriptomic methods offer promising approaches to tackle this challenging system. Here, we used massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) to understand global transcriptional regulation patterns in Alexandrium tamarense cultures that were grown under four different conditions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated more than 40,000 unique short expression signatures gathered from the four conditions. Of these, about 11,000 signatures did not display detectable differential expression patterns. At a p-value < 1E-10, 1,124 signatures were differentially expressed in the three treatments, xenic, nitrogen-limited, and phosphorus-limited, compared to the nutrient-replete control, with the presence of bacteria explaining the largest set of these differentially expressed signatures. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Among microbial eukaryotes, dinoflagellates contain the largest number of genes in their nuclear genomes. These genes occur in complex families, many of which have evolved via recent gene duplication events. Our expression data suggest that about 73\% of the Alexandrium transcriptome shows no significant change in gene expression under the experimental conditions used here and may comprise a "core" component for this species. We report a fundamental shift in expression patterns in response to the presence of bacteria, highlighting the impact of biotic interaction on gene expression in dinoflagellates.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) plays a key role in the acquisition of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis in phytoplankton. Genes coding for the carbonic anhydrase CDCA, which can use either Cd or Zn as a metal center, are found in many diatom species and in natural seawater samples. The use of Cd in CDCA is the only known biological function of Cd and is thought to explain the nutrient-like concentration profile of Cd in the oceans. Here we report on the expression of CDCA in cultures of Thalassiosira weissflogii and in samples from the Equatorial Pacific and coastal New Jersey. CDCA1 is one of 2 types of CA found in T. weissflogii; its expression is highly modulated by pH changes and is induced by the addition of Cd. Attempts to amplify cdca mRNA from samples of the Equatorial Pacific were not successful. However, protein bands from a sample incubated with Cd and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) reacted with CDCA antiserum, and a sample concentrated by immunoprecipitation yielded peptide sequences matching CDCA1. In samples from New Jersey coastal water, we found a high level of CDCA expression, which was inversely correlated with pCO2. CDCA is indeed expressed in ocean waters and is regulated in a manner consistent with its putative role in CO2 acquisition.},

Microalgae include cells derived from a primary endosymbiotic event (similar to land plants) and cells derived from subsequent secondary and/or tertiary endosymbiotic events. These latter cells are chimeras of several genomes and dominate primary production in the marine environment. Two consequences of multiple endosymbiotic events include complex targeting mechanisms to allow nuclear-encoded proteins to be imported into the plastid and coordination of enzymes, potentially from disparate originator cells, to form complete metabolic pathways. In this review, we discuss the forces that shaped the genomes of marine microalgae and then discuss some of the metabolic consequences of such a complex evolutionary history. We focus our metabolic discussion on carbon, nitrogen, and iron. We then discuss biomineralization and new evidence for programmed cell death in microalgae. We conclude with a short summary on advances in genetic manipulation of microalgae and thoughts on the future directions of marine algal genomics.},

abstract = {Use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify
 cDNA products reverse transcribed from mRNA is on the way to becoming
 a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression.
 Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy
 and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But
 accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible
 methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis.
 This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in
 real-time RTâPCR of a target gene transcript in comparison
 to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model
 is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from
 the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation
 of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration
 curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise
 each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading
 and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5\% variation)
 were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

abstract = {Copper appears to be influencing the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton in marine environments, and cyanobacteria are thought to be the most sensitive of the phytoplankton groups to copper toxicity. By using growth assays of phylogenetically divergent clades, we found that coastal strains of marine Synechococcus species were more tolerant to copper shock than open-ocean strains. The global transcriptional response to two levels of copper shock were determined for both a coastal strain and an open-ocean strain of marine Synechococcus species using whole-genome expression microarrays. Both strains showed an osmoregulatory-like response, perhaps as a result of increasing membrane permeability. This could have implications for marine carbon cycling if copper shock leads to dissolved organic carbon leakage in Synechococcus species. The two strains additionally showed a common reduction in levels of photosynthesis-related gene transcripts. Contrastingly, the open-ocean strain showed a general stress response, whereas the coastal strain exhibited a more specifically oxidative or heavy-metal acclimation response that may be conferring tolerance. In addition, the coastal strain activated more regulatory elements and transporters, many of which are not conserved in other marine Synechococcus strains and may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Thus, tolerance to copper shock in some marine Synechococcus strains may in part be a result of a generally increased ability to sense and respond in a more stress-specific manner.},

abstract = {Iron (Fe) availability restricts diatom growth and primary production in large areas of the oceans. It is a challenge to assess the bulk Fe nutritional health of natural diatom populations, since species can differ in their physiological and molecular responses to Fe limitation. We assayed expression of selected genes in diatoms from the Thalassiosira genus to assess their potential utility as species-specific molecular markers to indicate Fe status in natural diatom assemblages. In this study, we compared the expression of the photosynthetic genes encoding ferredoxin (a Fe-requiring protein) and flavodoxin (a Fe-free protein) in culture experiments with Fe replete and Fe stressed Thalassiosira pseudonana (CCMP 1335) isolated from coastal waters and Thalassiosira weissflogii (CCMP 1010) isolated from the open ocean. In T. pseudonana, expression of flavodoxin and ferredoxin genes were not sensitive to Fe status but were found to display diel periodicities. In T. weissflogii, expression of flavodoxin was highly responsive to iron levels and was only detectable when cultures were Fe limited. Flavodoxin genes have been duplicated in most diatoms with available genome data and we show that T. pseudonana has lost its copy related to the Fe-responsive copy in T. weissflogii. We also examined the expression of genes for a putative high affinity, copper (Cu)-dependent Fe uptake system in T. pseudonana. Our results indicate that genes encoding putative Cu transporters, a multi-Cu oxidase, and a Fe reductase are not linked to Fe status. The expression of a second putative Fe reductase increased in Fe limited cultures, but this gene was also highly expressed in Fe replete cultures, indicating it may not be a useful marker in the field. Our findings highlight that Fe metabolism may differ among diatoms even within a genus and show a need to validate responses in different species as part of the development pipeline for genetic markers of Fe status in field populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent technological advancements have made high throughput sequencing an increasingly popular approach for transcriptome analysis. Advantages of sequencing-based transcriptional profiling over microarrays have been reported, including lower technical variability. However, advances in technology do not remove biological variation between replicates and this variation is often neglected in many analyses. RESULTS: We propose an empirical Bayes method, titled Analysis of Sequence Counts (ASC), to detect differential expression based on sequencing technology. ASC borrows information across sequences to establish prior distribution of sample variation, so that biological variation can be accounted for even when replicates are not available. Compared to current approaches that simply tests for equality of proportions in two samples, ASC is less biased towards highly expressed sequences and can identify more genes with a greater log fold change at lower overall abundance. CONCLUSIONS: ASC unifies the biological and statistical significance of differential expression by estimating the posterior mean of log fold change and estimating false discovery rates based on the posterior mean. The implementation in R is available at http://www.stat.brown.edu/Zwu/research.aspx.},

abstract = {Shotgun mass spectrometry was used to detect proteins in the harmful alga, Aureococcus anophagefferens, and monitor their relative abundance across nutrient replete (control), phosphate-deficient (-P) and -P refed with phosphate (P-refed) conditions. Spectral counting techniques identified differentially abundant proteins and demonstrated that under phosphate deficiency, A. anophagefferens increases proteins involved in both inorganic and organic phosphorus (P) scavenging, including a phosphate transporter, 5'-nucleotidase, and alkaline phosphatase. Additionally, an increase in abundance of a sulfolipid biosynthesis protein was detected in -P and P-refed conditions. Analysis of the polar membrane lipids showed that cellular concentrations of the sulfolipid sulphoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) were nearly two-fold greater in the -P condition versus the control condition, while cellular phospholipids were approximately 8-fold less. Transcript and protein abundances were more tightly coupled for gene products involved in P metabolism compared to those involved in a range of other metabolic functions. Comparison of protein abundances between the -P and P-refed conditions identified differences in the timing of protein degradation and turnover. This suggests that culture studies examining nutrient starvation responses will be valuable in interpreting protein abundance patterns for cellular nutritional status and history in metaproteomic datasets.},

  to help choose among them. We provide a systematic framework for
  assessing the results of clustering algorithms. Clustering
  algorithms attempt to partition the genes into groups exhibiting

  is to apply a clustering algorithm to the data from all but one
  experimental condition. The remaining condition is used to assess
  the predictive power of the resulting clustersâmeaningful
  clusters should exhibit less variation in the remaining condition
  than clusters formed by chance.Results: We successfully applied our methodology to compare six

The completion of the Chlamydomonas genome sequence makes it possible to use reverse genetic approaches in this organism. Chlamydomonas contains a set of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) that down-regulate their target gene expression through mRNA cleavage. Here we developed an artificial miRNA-based strategy to knock down gene expression in Chlamydomonas. Using an endogenous Chlamydomonas miRNA precursor as the backbone, we constructed two artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) targeting the MAA7 and RBCS1/2 genes, respectively. When overexpressed, these two amiRNAs could cleave their respective targets precisely at the predicted sites, resulting in greatly decreased accumulation of MAA7 and RBCS1/2 transcripts and expected mutant phenotypes. We further showed that the two amiRNAs could be produced simultaneously from a dimeric amiRNA precursor. We anticipate that the amiRNA technology developed in this study will be very useful in assessing the functions of individual genes and in genome-wide approaches.},
