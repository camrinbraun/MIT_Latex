%Supplemental Figure 8: Shifts in CORE

\begin{figure}[p!]

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/C6_FigureS8_core_genes.pdf}
  \caption[The relative expression of `core', shared, and CCMP1516-specific transcripts across time and in incubation experiments]{The relative expression of `core', shared, and CCMP1516-specific transcripts across time and in incubation experiments. The percentage of all mapped reads corresponding to the genes considered to be `core' by Read et al. (2013) (black), found to be shared across the five strains used in this study (grey), or originally considered to be unique to CCMP1516 are plotted for each \textit{in situ} sample (A) and in each of the two replicated incubation experiments, E1 (B) and E2 (C). Nutrients added to incubation experiments are indicated on the exterior of the radar plots, indicating the addition of nitrate, phosphate, trace metals, and vitamins.}

%Supplemental Figure 2: KOG distributions across genes

%Supplemental Figure 3: Distributions across genes

    \caption[The number of orthologous groups falling into each of the possible strain sets across the five strains surveyed]{The number of orthologous groups falling into each of the possible strain sets across the five strains surveyed. The relative strain membership is depicted in a scatter plot along the x-axis ranging from the first row of 'shared' or `core' genes, common to all strains (black), through variable memberships across some but not all strains, to sets comprised of only one strain (colored). Genes common to all strains in this study are shown in black. Genes identified as `core' in CCMP1516, the genome strain, by Read et al. (2013), but that were not identified in some or all of the other strains were added to the `shared' set and are indicated in yellow hatching. }

%Supplemental Figure 4: MANTA

\begin{figure}[p!]

    \caption[Log normalized fold change plotted against log normalized average abundance for each of the five amended treatments compared to the no-addition control]{Log normalized fold change plotted against log normalized average abundance for each of the five amended treatments compared to the no-addition control. edgeR was used to assess the average abundance and log fold change for each of the orthologous groups (left column) and strain-specific transcripts (right column). Genes are colored by generalized metabolic function. The intensity of the color indicates significance, with opaque indicating significance (FDR < 0.05). }

%Supplemental Figure 6: Carbon, Nucleotide etc. 


\begin{figure}[p!]

    \caption[Fold change of genes associated with carbon, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism across each of the incubation amendments]{Fold change of genes associated with carbon, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism across each of the incubation amendments compared to the no addition control. The log fold change of orthologous groups associated with carbon, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism was assessed with edgeR across the five amended incubations compared to the no addition control are plotted in opaque grey. The size of the orthologous group marker is proportionate to the log of the mean abundance across the two treatments. Orthologous groups are that are significantly differentially abundant (FDR < 0.05) are plotted highlighted in red. Individual transcripts within an orthologous group are plotted in light grey or red to indicate significance of fold change. Genes of interest are labeled with abbreviations as follows, labels in bold indicate significant regulation in two or more conditions. }

The relative percentage of orthologous groups able to be annotated for all orthologous groups (A) and orthologous group shared amongst the five studied strains (B) are shown.
