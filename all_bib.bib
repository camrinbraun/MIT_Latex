	Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modelling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks Isurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level ({\textless}100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.},

	Abstract = {Geolocation of fish based on data from archival tags typically requires a statistical analysis to reduce the effect of measurement errors. In this paper we present a novel technique for this analysis, one based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM's). We assume that the actual path of the fish is generated by a biased random walk. The HMM methodology produces, for each time step, the probability that the fish resides in each grid cell. Because there is no Monte Carlo step in our technique, we are able to estimate parameters within the likelihood framework. The method does not require the distribution to be Gaussian or belong to any other of the usual families of distributions and can thus address constraints from shorelines and other nonlinear effects; the method can and does produce bimodal distributions. We discuss merits and limitations of the method, and perspectives for the more general problem of inference in state-space models of animals. The technique can be applied to geolocation based on light, on tidal patterns, or measurement of other variables that vary with space. We illustrate the method through application to a simulated data set where geolocation relies on depth data exclusively.},

	Abstract = {Advection-diffusion models have been used successfully to describe the time and place of recapture of tuna tagged with conventional dart tags. Such models are the continuous analogs of a biased random walk. This paper demonstrates how biased random walks can be used to simulate large scale movements of tunas as recorded by archival tags in a way that captures all of the major characteristics of the tracks. The parameters of the biased random walk model are identical to the parameters of the advection diffusion model, suggesting that a joint parameter estimation procedure might be feasible. Finally, the potential application of the Kalman filter to the analysis of tracking data is discussed. This statistical model has the potential to increase the accuracy of geoposition estimates from tracking devices as well as to estimate biased random walk parameters from tracking data.},

@incollection{Sims2008,
	Abstract = {Abstract The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus is the world's second largest fish reaching lengths up to 12 m and weighing up to 4 tonnes. It inhabits warm‐temperate to boreal waters circumglobally and has been the subject of fisheries exploitation for at least 200 years. There is current concern over its population levels as a consequence of directed harpoon and net fisheries that in the north‐east Atlantic Ocean alone took over 100,000 mature individuals between 1946 and 1997. As a consequence, it is not known whether populations are recovering or are at a fraction of their historical, pre‐fishing biomass. They are currently Red‐listed as vulnerable globally, and endangered in the north‐east Atlantic. The basking shark is one of only three shark species that filter seawater for planktonic prey and this strategy dominates key aspects of its life history. Until recently, very little was known about the biology, ecology and behaviour of this elusive species. The advent of satellite‐linked electronic tags for tracking has resulted in considerable progress in furthering our understanding of basking shark behaviour, foraging, activity patterns, horizontal and vertical movements, migrations and broader scale distributions. Genetic studies are also beginning to reveal important insights into aspects of their global population structure, behaviour and evolutionary history. This chapter reviews the taxonomy, distribution and habitat, bionomics and life history, behaviour, population structure, exploitation, management and conservation status of the basking shark. In doing so, it reveals that whilst important behavioural and ecological information has been gained, there are still considerable gaps in knowledge. In particular, these relate to the need to resolve population sizes, spatial dynamics such as population sub‐structuring and sexual segregation, the critical habitats occupied by pregnant females, and the distribution and scale of fishery by‐catch rates. Although challenging, it is arguable that without achieving these goals the conservation status of the basking shark will be difficult to assess accurately.},

@article{Werry2014,
	Abstract = {Knowledge of the habitat use and migration patterns of large sharks is important for assessing the effectiveness of large predator Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), vulnerability to fisheries and environmental influences, and management of shark--human interactions. Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km3. The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.},

	Abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are capable of storing high-resolution behavioral and environmental information for extended periods of time (approximately 1 year), rendering them especially valuable for studying highly mobile species. In this review, we synthesize published PSAT data to understand the biophysical drivers that influence movements of billfishes (families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae). To date, over 1,080 PSATs have been deployed on billfishes, with individuals demonstrating both trans-equatorial and trans-basin movements. Using this dataset, we identify four main physical variables that drive billfish behavior: temperature, light, oxygen, and complex water mixing (e.g. fronts and eddies). Of the seven species that have been studied with PSAT technology, all exhibited a strong thermal preference for water {\textgreater}22$\,^{\circ}$C, though vertically migrating swordfish additionally occupied waters {\textless}10$\,^{\circ}$C while at depth. Ambient light levels influence vertical movements, especially those associated with foraging, as billfish possess large eyes and thermoregulatory abilities that facilitate feeding behaviors below warm surface layers. Mounting evidence suggests that some billfishes actively avoid regions with low dissolved oxygen ({\textless}3.5 mL L¿1). Human-induced climate change is expected to increase the horizontal and vertical extent of hypoxic water and may further compress habitat and concentrate fishing pressure on pelagic fishes. Finally, complex submeso- and mesoscale processes provide critical habitat for spawning, larval feeding, and retention, but our understanding of these and other behavioral aspects of billfish biology remains limited. Future research efforts should leverage technical advancements while integrating existing and future tag data with chemical and physical oceanographic datasets to gain a better understanding of the relevant biophysical interactions for billfishes, thereby enhancing management capabilities for this ecologically and economically important group of fishes.},

These include coastal return migrations and the fastest known transoceanic return migration among swimming fauna, which provide direct evidence of a link between widely separated populations in South Africa and Australia. Transoceanic return migration involved a return to the original capture location, dives to depths of 980 meters, and the tolerance of water temperatures as low as 3.4 degrees C. These findings contradict previous ideas that female white sharks do not make transoceanic. migrations, and they suggest natal homing behavior.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent successful efforts to increase protection for manta rays has highlighted the lack of basic ecological information, including vertical and horizontal movement patterns, available for these species. We deployed pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags on nine reef manta rays, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Manta alfredi{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, to determine diving behaviors and vertical habitat use. Transmitted and archived data were obtained from seven tagged mantas over deployment periods of 102--188 days, including three recovered tags containing 2.6 million depth, temperature, and light level data points collected every 10 or 15 seconds. Mantas frequented the upper 10 m during daylight hours and tended to occupy deeper water throughout the night. Six of the seven individuals performed a cumulative 76 deep dives ({\textgreater}150 m) with one individual reaching 432 m, extending the known depth range of this coastal, reef-oriented species and confirming its role as an ecological link between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Mean vertical velocities calculated from high-resolution dive data (62 dives {\textgreater}150 m) from three individuals suggested that mantas may use gliding behavior during travel and that this behavior may prove more efficient than continuous horizontal swimming. The behaviors in this study indicate manta rays provide a previously unknown link between the epi- and mesopelagic layers of an extremely oligotrophic marine environment and provide evidence of a third marine species that utilizes gliding to maximize movement efficiency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The larvae are transported back to European waters by the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift. However, details of the spawning migration remain unknown because tracking eels in the Atlantic Ocean has, so far, eluded study. Recent advances in satellite tracking enable investigation of migratory behavior of large ocean-dwelling animals. However, sizes of available tags have precluded tracking smaller animals like European eels. Here, we present information about the swimming direction, depth, and migratory behavior of European eels during spawning migration, based on a miniaturized pop-up satellite archival transmitter. Although the tagging experiment fell short of revealing the full migration to the Sargasso Sea, the data covered the first 1300 km and provided unique insights.},

	Abstract = {A common-sense view of the marine environment as a fluid medium would probably imply progressive changes and smooth gradients in physical properties. Sharp boundaries, however, are actually quite widespread and are generally known as ``fronts'' or ``convergences'' from one major aspect of the associated circulation. In the days of classical oceanography, these terms were applied mainly to wholesale oceanic features, such as the Antarctic Convergence, or Polar Front, which runs around the whole globe between the latitudes 50$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ S. Over the two or three past decades, however, increasing attention has been paid to a variety of hydrographic structures, all of them being termed ``fronts'', ranging from the above-mentioned planetary features to small river plumes. The harvest of new fronts became especially large in the late seventies, when satellite-borne infrared radiometry, originally devised for night mapping of cloud patterns in meteorological surveys, underwent technical improvements which allowed it to be efficiently used for sea-surface temperature monitoring. As a result, the limit between what should and what should not be called a front can sometimes appear rather fuzzy. With regard to frontal structures in north-west European waters and their influence on pelagic ecosystems, the tide turns out to be both the common ultimate cause of a number of phenomena and the source of their variety.},

However, recent acoustic observations show that mesopelagic fishes biomass could be significantly larger than the current estimate. Here we combine modelling and a sensitivity analysis of the acoustic observations from the Malaspina 2010 Circumnavigation Expedition to show that the previous estimate needs to be revised to at least one order of magnitude higher. We show that there is a close relationship between the open ocean fishes biomass and primary production, and that the energy transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to mesopelagic fishes in the open ocean is higher than what is typically assumed. Our results indicate that the role of mesopelagic fishes in oceanic ecosystems and global ocean biogeochemical cycles needs to be revised as they may be respiring {\~{}}10{\%} of the primary production in deep waters.},

	Abstract = {Movements of wide-ranging top predators can now be studied effectively using satellite and archival telemetry. However, the motivations underlying movements remain difficult to determine because trajectories are seldom related to key biological gradients, such as changing prey distributions. Here, we use a dynamic prey landscape of zooplankton biomass in the north-east Atlantic Ocean to examine active habitat selection in the plankton-feeding basking shark Cetorhinus maximus. The relative success of shark searches across this landscape was examined by comparing prey biomass encountered by sharks with encounters by random-walk simulations of 'model' sharks. Movements of transmitter-tagged sharks monitored for 964 days (16 754 km estimated minimum distance) were concentrated on the European continental shelf in areas characterized by high seasonal productivity and complex prey distributions. We show movements by adult and sub-adult sharks yielded consistently higher prey encounter rates than 90{\%} of random-walk simulations. Behavioural patterns were consistent with basking sharks using search tactics structured across multiple scales to exploit the richest prey areas available in preferred habitats. Simple behavioural rules based on learned responses to previously encountered prey distributions may explain the high performances. This study highlights how dynamic prey landscapes enable active habitat selection in large predators to be investigated from a trophic perspective, an approach that may inform conservation by identifying critical habitat of vulnerable species.},

	Abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed to geolocate fish from data storage tags. Whereas demersal species have been tracked using tide-driven geolocation models, pelagic species which undertake extensive migrations have been mainly tracked using light-based models. Here, we present a new HMM-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields-satellite SST and temperatures derived from the MARS3D hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags (DSTs) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.},

	Abstract = {The world's second largest fish, the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), is broadly distributed in boreal to warm temperate latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean. Previous satellite archival tagging in the North Atlantic has shown that basking sharks move seasonally, are often associated with productive frontal zones, and may make occasional dives to mesopelagic depths. However, basking sharks are thought to be restricted to temperate latitudes, and the extent to which they exploit deeper-water habitat remains enigmatic. Via satellite archival tags and a novel geolocation technique, we demonstrate here that basking sharks are seasonal migrants to mesopelagic tropical waters. Tagged sharks moved from temperate feeding areas off the coast of southern New England to the Bahamas, the Caribbean Sea, and onward to the coast of South America and into the Southern Hemisphere. When in these areas, basking sharks descended to mesopelagic depths and in some cases remained there for weeks to months at a time. Our results demonstrate that tropical waters are not a barrier to migratory connectivity for basking shark populations and highlight the need for global conservation efforts throughout the species range.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that link oceanographic processes and marine vertebrate space use is critical to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning, and for effective management of populations of conservation concern. The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus has been observed in association with oceanographic fronts -- physical interfaces at the transitions between water masses -- exploiting foraging opportunities resulting from zooplankton aggregation. However, the scale, significance and variability of these associations have not previously been established. Here, we quantify the influence of thermal and chlorophyll-a fronts on basking shark habitat use in the north-east Atlantic. We use animal-mounted archival tracking together with composite front mapping via Earth Observation (EO) remote sensing to provide an oceanographic context to shark movements. We investigate levels of association with fronts occurring over two spatio-temporal scales, (i) broad-scale, seasonally persistent frontal zones and (ii) contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts. Using random walk simulations and logistic regression within an iterative generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework, we find that seasonal front frequency is a significant predictor of shark presence. Oceanographic metrics time-matched to shark tracks indicate that sharks show a preference for productive regions and associate with contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts more frequently than could be expected at random. Moreover, we highlight the importance of front persistence and cross-frontal temperature step, which appear to interact to affect the degree of prey aggregation along thermal fronts in this shelf-sea system. Our findings confirm that surface frontal activity is a predictor of basking shark presence in the north-east Atlantic, both over seasonal timescales and in near real-time. These insights have clear implications for understanding the preferred habitats of basking sharks in the context of anthropogenic threat management and marine spatial planning in the region.},

The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is the world's second largest fish species, however, a comprehensive understanding of their long-term wider-ranging movements in the northeast Atlantic is currently lacking. Seventy satellite tags were deployed on basking sharks over four years (2012--2015) off the west coast of Scotland and the Isle of Man. Data from 28 satellite tags with attachment durations of over 165 days reveal post-summer ranging behaviours. Tagged sharks moved a median minimum straight-line distance of 3,633km; achieving median displacement of 1,057km from tagging locations. Tagged individuals exhibited one of three migration behaviours: remaining in waters of UK, Ireland and the Faroe Islands; migrating south to the Bay of Biscay or moving further south to waters off the Iberian Peninsula, and North Africa. Sharks used both continental shelf areas and oceanic habitats, primarily in the upper 50--200m of the water column, spanning nine geo-political zones and the High Seas, demonstrating the need for multi-national cooperation in the management of this species across its range.},

During the assumed spawning period, 56{\%} of the tagged ABFT occupied a known spawning area, while 44{\%} were located in distant oceanic regions. Assuming obligate annual spawning, these results are inconsistent with the notion of spawning site fidelity to the Gulf of Mexico. The ocean-wide migrations of adult ABFT tagged on a common forage ground suggest evidence of a metapopulation requiring more spatially explicit management than the current simple two-stock structure.},

Using optimum interpolation (OI), in situ and satellite observations are combined on a daily and 0.25$\,^{\circ}$ spatial grid to form an SST analysis, i.e., a spatially complete field. A large-scale bias adjustment of the input infrared SSTs is made using buoy and ship observations as a reference. This is particularly important for the time periods when volcanic aerosols from the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions are widespread globally. The main source of SSTs is the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), available from late 1981 to the present, which is also the temporal span of this CDR. The input and processing choices made to ensure a consistent dataset that meets the CDR requirements is summarized.

The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1$\,^{\circ}$ OI analyses.

	Abstract = {Fishery closed areas provide a resource management tool to protect predictable spawning aggregations of migratory fish species. Movement by individual fish however challenges the effectiveness of fishery closed areas. Recent developments in electronic tags and movement modelling offer new information to quantify fine-scale usages of fishery closed areas by free-ranging individuals. Conventional tagging data, on the other hand, inform on population broad-scale distribution patterns with respect to closed areas. Using the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population from the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence as a case study, we demonstrate how electronic tagging experiments can be supplemented with conventional tagging experiments to evaluate and redesign fishery closed areas. A geolocation model was used to estimate time of arrival, time of departure, and proportion of time that individual cod equipped with data-storage tags spent within a fishery closed area. Two optimization algorithms were developed to seek out the spatial and temporal designs that maximized the proportion of time that the fish equipped with data-storage tags spent inside the closed area, relative to its size and duration. Bootstrap analyses quantified the effects of inter-individual variability in closed area usages. Conventional tagging data were used to estimate the proportion of the spawning population density function encompassed by the closed area. Results from the electronic and conventional tagging experiments suggested that the fishery closed area in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence should be displaced south along the 200-m isobath and that the enforcement period be reduced. Electronic tagging data also suggested that alternative migratory behaviours within a population lead to disproportional levels of protection between migratory and non-migratory groups. A re-examination of past conventional tagging experiments in combination with recent electronic tagging experiments provides new information to evaluate the spatiotemporal design of fishery closed areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Some marine species have been shown to target foraging at particular hotspots of high prey abundance. However, we show here that in the year after a nesting season, female leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic generally spend relatively little time in fixed hotspots, especially those with a surface signature revealed in satellite imagery, but rather tend to have a pattern of near continuous traveling. Associated with this traveling, distinct changes in dive behavior indicate that turtles constantly fine tune their foraging behavior and diel activity patterns in association with local conditions. Switches between nocturnal vs. diurnal activity are rare in the animal kingdom but may be essential for survival on a diet of gelatinous zooplankton where patches of high prey availability are rare. These results indicate that in their first year after nesting, leatherback turtles do not fit the general model of migration where responses to resources are suppressed during transit. However, their behavior may be different in their sabbatical years away from nesting beaches. Our results highlight the importance of whole-ocean fishing gear regulations to minimize turtle bycatch.},

	Abstract = {Conservation efforts aimed at the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, remain limited by a lack of basic information on most aspects of its ecology, including global population structure, population sizes and movement patterns. Here we report on the movements of 47 Red Sea whale sharks fitted with three types of satellite transmitting tags from 2009-2011. Most of these sharks were tagged at a single aggregation site near Al-Lith, on the central coast of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. Individuals encountered at this site were all juveniles based on size estimates ranging from 2.5-7 m total length with a sex ratio of approximately 1∶1. All other known aggregation sites for juvenile whale sharks are dominated by males. Results from tagging efforts showed that most individuals remained in the southern Red Sea and that some sharks returned to the same location in subsequent years. Diving data were recorded by 37 tags, revealing frequent deep dives to at least 500 m and as deep as 1360 m. The unique temperature-depth profiles of the Red Sea confirmed that several whale sharks moved out of the Red Sea while tagged. The wide-ranging horizontal movements of these individuals highlight the need for multinational, cooperative efforts to conserve R. typus populations in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.},

	Abstract = {A newly developed hybrid-coordinate ocean circulation model is documented and tested. Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables (??, S versus T, S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An alternative mechanism of local generation is offered herein, in which eddy-wind interaction can create lens-shaped disturbances in the thermocline. Numerical simulations illustrate how eddy-wind-driven upwelling in anticyclones can yield a convex lens reminiscent of a mode water eddy, whereas eddy-wind-driven downwelling in cyclones produces a concave lens that thins the mode water layer (a cyclonic 'thinny'). Such transformations should be observable with long-term time series in the interiors of mesoscale eddies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	Abstract = {Despite increasing evidence that marine predators associate with mesoscale eddies, how these marine features influence foraging movements is still unclear. This study investigates the relationship of at-sea movements of king penguins to mesoscale eddies using oceanographic remote sensing and movement data from 43 individual trips over 4 years. Simultaneous satellite measurements provided information on gradients of sea surface temperature and currents associated with eddies determined from altimetry. Penguins tended to swim rapidly with currents as they travelled towards foraging zones. Swimming speed indicative of foraging occurred within mesoscale fronts and strong currents associated with eddies at the Polar Front. These results demonstrate the importance of mesoscale eddies in directing foraging efforts to allow predators to rapidly get to rich areas where high concentrations of prey are likely to be encountered. When returning to the colony to relieve the incubating partner or to feed the chick, the birds followed a direct and rapid path, seemingly ignoring currents.},

@article{Gaube2017DSR,
	Abstract = {The Gulf Stream region contains strong mesoscale variability that significantly influences planktonic ecosystems residing therein. Meanders of the Gulf Stream can be identified as eastward propagating features in maps of sea level anomaly. These meanders can become unstable and pinch off to form nonlinear mesoscale eddies (rings) that trap large parcels of water. Following formation, ecosystems trapped within these eddies are subjected to temporally varying vertical velocities throughout their lifetime. As a result of both horizontal advection and vertical fluxes, multiple physical-biological mechanisms can simultaneously influence phytoplankton communities trapped in eddies. In this study we examine how the near-surface chlorophyll field (CHL) evolves in meanders and eddies by comparing satellite observations with an eddy-resolving ocean model. Prior in situ and satellite observations have revealed that during the formation of cyclonic Gulf Stream meanders, water with elevated CHL is transported southward. In anticyclonic meanders, water with reduced CHL is transported northward. Alternating submesoscale patches of upwelling and downwelling occur along the meandering front; however, evidence of a biological response to meander-induced vertical motion was not observed in meander-centric composite averages. During the formation of nonlinear Gulf Stream eddies, elevated and suppressed CHL is trapped and subsequently transported westward in cyclones and anticyclones, respectively. Following formation, CHL is observed to increase in the cores of anticyclones. The observed positive trend in CHL in anticyclones is consistent with the influence of eddy-induced Ekman pumping (eddy/wind interaction) that generates upwelling in anticyclones and downwelling in cyclones. To substantiate the influence of eddy-induced Ekman pumping on CHL in Gulf Stream eddies, two separate eddy-resolving physical-biological simulations are compared. The first simulation is forced with a realistic surface stress that includes the influence of ocean surface currents. The second simulation neglects this process. The time evolution of CHL within eddies is very different in these two simulations. The model that includes eddy-induced Ekman pumping generates temporal trends in CHL that are similar to the observations.},

	Abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are important suppliers of nutrients to the surface waters of oligotrophic gyres, but little is known about the biological response, particularly that of higher trophic levels, to these physical perturbations. During the summers of 2004 and 2005, we followed the development of a cyclonic eddy and an anti-cyclonic mode-water eddy in the Sargasso Sea. Zooplankton ({\textgreater}150 $\mu$m) were collected across both eddies in 9 discrete depth intervals between 0 and 700 m. Comparison of the abundance of major taxa of mesozooplankton in the upper 150 m at eddy center and outside the eddies (day and night) indicated that the cyclone and mode-water eddy supported similar mesozooplankton communities, with several taxa significantly higher in abundance inside than outside the eddies, when compared with the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site as representative of mean conditions. In both eddies copepod peak abundance occurred in the 50-100 m depth interval, coincident with the chlorophyll a maximum, suggesting elevated food concentration in the eddies may have influenced zooplankton vertical distribution. The two eddies differed in the strength of diel vertical migration of zooplankton, as indicated by the ratio of night:day abundance in the epipelagic zone, which was higher at the center of the mode-water eddy for most taxa. Over the sampling interval of 1-2 months, abundance of the three most common taxa (copepods, chaetognaths, and ostracods) decreased in the cyclone and increased in the mode-water eddy. This further supports previous findings that over the sampling period the cyclone was in a decay phase, while the mode-water eddy was sustaining nutrient fluxes and high phytoplankton concentrations. A more detailed analysis of community structure in the mode-water eddy indicated the 0-700 m integrated abundance of doliolids was significantly higher inside the mode-water eddy than outside. The presence of a mesopelagic (200-700 m) layer of lepadid barnacle cyprids in this eddy highlights the potential of eddies to transport and disperse biota. We conclude that when compared with average ambient conditions (as measured at BATS), mesoscale eddies can influence zooplankton behavior and alter zooplankton community structure which can affect food-web interactions and biogeochemical cycling in the open ocean. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Throughout the ocean, countless small animals swim to depth in the daytime, presumably to seek refuge from large predators1,2. These animals return to the surface at night to feed1,2. This substantial diel vertical migration can result in the transfer of significant amounts of carbon and nutrients from the surface to depth3--7. However, its consequences on ocean chemistry at the global scale have remained uncertain8,9. Here, we determine the depths of these diel migrations in the global ocean using a global array of backscatter data from acoustic Doppler current profilers, collected between 1990 and 2011. We show that the depth of diel migration follows coherent large-scale patterns. We find that migration depth is greater where subsurface oxygen concentrations are high, such that seawater oxygen concentration is the best single predictor of migration depth at the global scale. In oxygen minimum zone areas, migratory animals generally descend as far as the upper margins of the low-oxygen waters. Using an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general circulation model, we show that by focusing oxygen consumption in poorly ventilated regions of the upper ocean, diel vertical migration intensifies oxygen depletion in the upper margin of oxygen minimum zones.

	Abstract = {Abstract In the North Atlantic, blue shark has become an important by-catch species for the pelagic swordfish fisheries, and even the target species of these fisheries when swordfish abundance is low. Still, their complex life cycle and population structure remain poorly understood, limiting current management and conservation efforts for this species. This study provides information on the population structure and seasonal abundance of blue shark around the Azores Archipelago, in the central North Atlantic, based on detailed analyses of fishery independent and observer data for the area. A total of 23,119 blue sharks were sampled during 388 research longline fishing sets conducted between 1993 and 2004. Standardised catch rates varied greatly over the year, reflecting the changing presence of different sex and life stages in the area, and were strongly influenced by environmental factors, namely sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomalies and lunar cycle. In general, the catches were strongly dominated by juveniles, with higher catch rates during winter months. Young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles of both sexes were present throughout the year. While older juvenile and sub-adult females dominated during winter, juvenile males dominated during the rest of the year, indicating that different juvenile life stages of both sexes alternate in using the area. The presence of mature females in advanced stages of pregnancy during spring, and the appearance of the smallest size-classes of YOY in early summer also suggest that the area is used as a pupping ground. Mature males appear mainly during summer, probably for feeding. The periodic presence of all these life stages emphasises the central role of the area, as some of these population components are seasonally associated with one of either sides of the North Atlantic.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThree mechanisms for self-induced Ekman pumping in the interiors of mesoscale ocean eddies are investigated. The first arises from the surface stress that occurs because of differences between surface wind and ocean velocities, resulting in Ekman upwelling and downwelling in the cores of anticyclones and cyclones, respectively. The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the surface stress with the surface current vorticity gradient, resulting in dipoles of Ekman upwelling and downwelling. The third mechanism arises from eddy-induced spatial variability of sea surface temperature (SST), which generates a curl of the stress and therefore Ekman pumping in regions of crosswind SST gradients. The spatial structures and relative magnitudes of the three contributions to eddy-induced Ekman pumping are investigated by collocating satellite-based measurements of SST, geostrophic velocity, and surface winds to the interiors of eddies identified from their sea surface height signatures.

	Abstract = {Micronekton biomass was sampled in warm-core Gulf Stream ring 82-B (at ages 2, 4 and 6 months), the Slope Water, the Gulf Stream and the Sargasso Sea during three multi-ship cruises. There was no significant diel difference in the 0-1000 m integrated biomass for fishes or invertebrate micronekton in 24 paired day-night tows, and no evidence for diel vertical migration across the 1000 m level. Biomass showed a consistent upward shift at night; although it varied with hydrographic regime and sampling date, median biomass depth shift for invertebrates averaged 184 and 137 m for fishes. For total micronekton, median biomass depth ranged from 550 to 750 m by day and 300 to 600 m by night. Fish biomass was always centered deeper than 250 m, while the center of invertebrate biomass rose above that level in only one of 12 night tows. In April, ring-core biomass for fishes and invertebrates (2.2 and 11.9 cc m-2, respectively) was significantly lower than that for the high velocity region (3.6 and 19.8 cc m-2) or that for the Slope Water (4.7 and 20.8 cc m-2). By June, ring-core standing stocks had doubled while that for the high velocity region had been reduced to half of the April levels. No significant changes in Slope Water biomass occurred over the April-August period. Fluctuations in ring-core micronekton biomass were probably due to both in situ processes and advective exchange. On the average, invertebrate biomass was about 4 times that of fish biomass. Total micronekton was 20-30{\%} of the macrozooplankton biomass in April and June, and 7-16{\%} in August. Vertically, the invertebrate fraction overlapped the macrozooplankton more than did the fish fraction. Greater overlap of micronekton and macrozooplankton occurred at night. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Concurrently, Sippican T5 XBTs (eXpendable Bathy Thermographs) were used to profile temperatures to 1800m. In each year the scattering layers spanned the deep basin at depths ranging from near surface to approximately 900m, but annual mean densities differed significantly. Higher DSL densities were recorded during years that exhibited higher sea temperatures at the depths of major DSL concentration (400-600m), higher sea level anomalies and stronger eastward geostrophic currents. The highest concentration of the DSLs in each year was found in the area east of the Grand Banks that corresponded with areas of anticyclonic eddies. In this region DSL densities in 2014 were among the highest recorded worldwide ({\textgreater}7000m2nauticalmile-2). Midwater fishing indicated DSLs were dominated by Myctophids and Sternoptychids. Anticyclonic eddy formation is discussed as a possible means of transport and aggregation of the DSLs in that region, where oceanographic influences may play a dominant role in the distribution and density of the DSLs and upper trophic level fishes.},

@article{Cotte2015,
	Abstract = {The open ocean is a highly variable environment where marine top predators are thought to require optimized foraging strategies to locate and capture prey. Mesoscale and sub-mesoscale features are known to effect planktonic organisms but the response of top predators to these features results from behavioural choices and is poorly understood. Here, we investigated a multi-year database of at-sea distribution and behaviour of female Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) to identify their preference for specific structures within the intense eddy field of the dynamic Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). We distinguished two behavioural modes, i.e. travelling and intensive foraging, using state-space modelling. We employed multisatellite Lagrangian diagnostics to describe properties of (sub-)mesoscale oceanic circulation. Statistical analyses (GAMMs and Student's t-tests) revealed relationships between elephant seal behaviour and (sub-)mesoscale features during the post-moulting period (January-August): travelling along thermal fronts and intensive foraging in cold and long-lived mesoscale water patches. A Lagrangian analysis suggests that these water patches - where the prey field likely developed and concentrated - corresponded to waters which have supported the bloom during spring. In contrast, no clear preference emerged at the (sub-)mesoscale during the post-breeding period (October-December), although seals were distributed within the Chlorophyll-rich water plume detaching from the plateau. We interpret this difference in terms of a seasonal change in the prey field. Our interdisciplinary approach contributes to elucidate the foraging strategies of top predators in a complex and dynamic environment. It also brings top down insights on prey distribution in remote areas where information on mid-trophic levels are strongly lacking and it identifies important physical-biological interactions relevant for ecosystem modelling and management.},

The problems of analysing used-available data and presence-only data are equivalent, and this paper uses this equivalence as a platform for exploring opportunities for advancing analysis methodology. 2. We suggest some potential methodological advances in used-available analysis, made possible via lessons learnt in the presence-only literature, for example, using modern methods to improve predictive performance. We also consider the converse -- potential advances in presence-only analysis inspired by used-available methodology. 3. Notwithstanding these potential advances in methodology, perhaps a greater opportunity is in advancing our thinking about how to apply a given method to a particular data set. 4. It is shown by example that strikingly different results can be achieved for a single data set by applying a given method of analysis in different ways -- hence having chosen a method of analysis, the next step of working out how to apply it is critical to performance. 5. We review some key issues to consider in deciding how to apply an analysis method: apply the method in a manner that reflects the study design; consider data properties; and use diagnostic tools to assess how reasonable a given analysis is for the data at hand.},

	Abstract = {Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993--2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.},

We use Pacific saury catch and location data for a number of commercial fishery seasons in the region of the northwest Pacific with one of the richest fishery in the world. It is shown statistically that the saury fishing grounds with maximal catches are not randomly distributed over the region but located mainly along the sharp LFs where productive cold waters of the Oyashio Current, warmer waters of the southern branch of the Soya Current, and waters of warm-core Kuroshio rings converge. Computation of those fronts in altimetric geostrophic velocity fields both in the years with the First and Second Oyashio Intrusions shows that in spite of different oceanographic conditions LF locations may serve as good indicators of potential fishing grounds. Possible biophysical reasons for saury aggregation near sharp LFs are discussed. We propose a mechanism for effective export of nutrient rich waters based on stretching of material lines in the vicinity of hyperbolic objects in the ocean. The developed method, based on identifying LFs in any velocity fields, is quite general and may be applied to find potential fishing grounds for the other pelagic fish. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Spatial predictions of blue shark (Prionace glauca) catch rate and catch probability of juveniles in the Southwest Atlantic. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 890-900. Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction was applied to catch per unit effort (cpue) data for blue shark (Prionace glauca) caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1997 and 2008 (43 546 longline sets) to predict the effect of environmental, spatial, and temporal factors on catch distribution. In addition, the size distribution of blue sharks measured by on-board observers during the years 2006-2008 was used to model the proportion of juvenile blue sharks in the catches from a spatial perspective. Latitude was the most important factor influencing blue shark cpue in the Southwest Atlantic, with cpue spatial predictions suggesting two areas of higher catch probabilities. Latitude was also the most important factor influencing the proportion of juveniles in the catches. The spatial prediction map showed that juveniles were more frequently caught south of 35{\{}degrees{\}}S ([{\~{}}]38{\{}degrees{\}}S). This information can assist in the design of management strategies either to exploit this predictable spatial distribution of the catch or to manage the fisheries in a spatially explicit manner if one component (i.e. juveniles) requires protective measures.},

	Abstract = {The biogeochemical role of phytoplanktonic organisms strongly varies from one plankton type to another, and their relative abundance and distribution have fundamental consequences at the global and climatological scales. In situ observations find dominant types often associated to specific physical and chemical water properties. However, the mechanisms and spatiotemporal scales by which marine ecosystems are organized are largely not known. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal organization of phytoplankton communities by combining multisatellite data, notably high-resolution ocean-color maps of dominant types and altimetry-derived Lagrangian diagnostics of the surface transport. We find that the phytoplanktonic landscape is organized in (sub-)mesoscale patches (10-100 km) of dominant types separated by physical fronts induced by horizontal stirring. These physical fronts delimit niches supported by water masses of similar history and whose lifetimes are comparable with the timescale of the bloom onset (few weeks). The resonance between biological activity and physical processes suggest that the spatiotemporal (sub-)mesoscales associated to stirring are determinant in the observation and modeling of marine ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Since the heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions drives abundance, distribution, and availability of prey, it is essential to understand how foraging predators interact with their dynamic environment at various spatial and temporal scales. We examined the spatio-temporal relationships between oceanographic features and abundance of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest free-ranging predator in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WM), through two independent approaches. First, spatial modeling was used to estimate whale density, using waiting distance (the distance between detections) for fin whales along ferry routes across the WM, in relation to remotely sensed oceanographic parameters. At a large scale (basin and year), fin whales exhibited fidelity to the northern WM with a summer-aggregated and winter-dispersed pattern. At mesoscale (20-100. km), whales were found in colder, saltier (from an on-board system) and dynamic areas defined by steep altimetric and temperature gradients. Second, using an independent fin whale satellite tracking dataset, we showed that tracked whales were effectively preferentially located in favorable habitats, i.e. in areas of high predicted densities as identified by our previous model using oceanographic data contemporaneous to the tracking period. We suggest that the large-scale fidelity corresponds to temporally and spatially predictable habitat of whale favorite prey, the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), while mesoscale relationships are likely to identify areas of high prey concentration and availability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are energetically dominant and pervasive over most of the world's oceans. Among them, many are subsurface intensified with strongest signals in the ocean interior such as mode-water eddies, which trap water masses with distinctive properties and carry them over long distances. With both Argo profiling floats and atmospheric reanalysis data we showed that the structure of these eddies obeys a universal rule. Hence their three-dimensional hydrographic fields can be readily reconstructed from very limited information. More interestingly, the volume of water trapped and moved by a mode-water eddy is much greater than previously thought; it has a three-compartment structure in the vertical with the mode water being sandwiched between two layers of notably different properties and accounting for only a portion of the total trapped volume.},

@article{Breed2017,
	Abstract = {Although predators influence behavior of prey, analyses of electronic tracking data in marine environments rarely consider how predators affect the behavior of tracked animals. We collected an unprecedented dataset by synchronously tracking predator (killer whales, [Formula: see text] = 1; representing a family group) and prey (narwhal, [Formula: see text] = 7) via satellite telemetry in Admiralty Inlet, a large fjord in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Analyzing the movement data with a switching-state space model and a series of mixed effects models, we show that the presence of killer whales strongly alters the behavior and distribution of narwhal. When killer whales were present (within about 100 km), narwhal moved closer to shore, where they were presumably less vulnerable. Under predation threat, narwhal movement patterns were more likely to be transiting, whereas in the absence of threat, more likely resident. Effects extended beyond discrete predatory events and persisted steadily for 10 d, the duration that killer whales remained in Admiralty Inlet. Our findings have two key consequences. First, given current reductions in sea ice and increases in Arctic killer whale sightings, killer whales have the potential to reshape Arctic marine mammal distributions and behavior. Second and of more general importance, predators have the potential to strongly affect movement behavior of tracked marine animals. Understanding predator effects may be as or more important than relating movement behavior to resource distribution or bottom-up drivers traditionally included in analyses of marine animal tracking data.},

@article{Queiroz2016,
	Abstract = {Overfishing is arguably the greatest ecological threat facing the oceans, yet catches of many highly migratory fishes including oceanic sharks remain largely unregulated with poor monitoring and data reporting. Oceanic shark conservation is hampered by basic knowledge gaps about where sharks aggregate across population ranges and precisely where they overlap with fishers. Using satellite tracking data from six shark species across the North Atlantic, we show that pelagic sharks occupy predictable habitat hotspots of high space use. Movement modeling showed sharks preferred habitats characterized by strong sea surface-temperature gradients (fronts) over other available habitats. However, simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of the entire Spanish and Portuguese longline-vessel fishing fleets show an 80{\%} overlap of fished areas with hotspots, potentially increasing shark susceptibility to fishing exploitation. Regions of high overlap between oceanic tagged sharks and longliners included the North Atlantic Current/Labrador Current convergence zone and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge southwest of the Azores. In these main regions, and subareas within them, shark/vessel co-occurrence was spatially and temporally persistent between years, highlighting how broadly the fishing exploitation efficiently ``tracks'' oceanic sharks within their space-use hotspots year-round. Given this intense focus of longliners on shark hotspots, our study argues the need for international catch limits for pelagic sharks and identifies a future role of combining fine-scale fish and vessel telemetry to inform the ocean-scale management of fisheries.},

Although recaptures of tagged sharks have shown that the species is highly migratory, migration pathways towards the overwintering grounds remain poorly understood. We used archival satellite pop-up tags to track 23 blue sharks over a mean period of 88 days as they departed the coastal waters of North America in the autumn. Within 1--2 days of entering the Gulf Stream (median date of 21 Oct), all sharks initiated a striking diel vertical migration, taking them from a mean nighttime depth of 74 m to a mean depth of 412 m during the day as they appeared to pursue vertically migrating squid and fish prey. Although functionally blind at depth, calculations suggest that there would be a ∼2.5-fold thermoregulatory advantage to swimming and feeding in the markedly cooler deep waters, even if there was any reduced foraging success associated with the extreme depth. Noting that the Gulf Stream current speeds are reduced at depth, we used a detailed circulation model of the North Atlantic to examine the influence of the diving behaviour on the advection experienced by the sharks. However, there was no indication that the shark diving resulted in a significant modification of their net migratory pathway. The relative abundance of deep-diving sharks, swordfish, and sperm whales in the Gulf Stream and adjacent waters suggests that it may serve as a key winter feeding ground for large pelagic predators in the North Atlantic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {The humpback whale population of New Caledonia appears to display a novel migratory pattern characterized by multiple directions, long migratory paths and frequent pauses over seamounts and other shallow geographical features. Using satellite-monitored radio tags, we tracked 34 whales for between 5 and 110 days, travelling between 270 and 8540 km on their southward migration from a breeding ground in southern New Caledonia. Mean migration speed was 3.53$\pm$2.22 km h(-1), while movements within the breeding ground averaged 2.01$\pm$1.63 km h(-1). The tag data demonstrate that seamounts play an important role as offshore habitats for this species. Whales displayed an intensive use of oceanic seamounts both in the breeding season and on migration. Seamounts probably serve multiple and important roles as breeding locations, resting areas, navigational landmarks or even supplemental feeding grounds for this species, which can be viewed as a transient component of the seamount communities. Satellite telemetry suggests that seamounts represent an overlooked cryptic habitat for the species. The frequent use by humpback whales of such remote locations has important implications for conservation and management.},

	Abstract = {1. Electronic tagging of marine fishes is commonly achieved with archival tags that rely on light levels and sea surface temperatures to retrospectively estimate movements. However, methodological issues associated with light-level geolocation have constrained meaningful inference to species where it is possible to accurately estimate time of sunrise and sunset. Most studies have largely ignored the oceanographic profiles collected by the tag as a potential way to refine light-level geolocation estimates. 2. Open-source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high-resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. 3. The R package HMMoce leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. 4. HMMoce exhibited as much as 6-fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light-level geolocation approaches. The results demonstrated the general applicability of HMMoce to marine animals, particularly those that do not frequent surface waters during crepuscular periods.},

Here, we derive worldwide patterns of tuna and billfish diversity over the past 50 years, revealing distinct subtropical "hotspots" that appeared to hold generally for other predators and zooplankton. Diversity was positively correlated with thermal fronts and dissolved oxygen and a nonlinear function of temperature (similar to 25 degrees C optimum). Diversity declined between 10 and 50{\%} in all. oceans, a trend that coincided with increased fishing pressure, superimposed on strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation-driven variability across the Pacific. We conclude that predator diversity shows a predictable yet eroding pattern signaling ecosystem-wide changes linked to climate and fishing.},

	Abstract = {Life in the ocean relies on the photosynthetic production of phytoplankton, which is influenced by the availability of light and nutrients that are modulated by a host of physical processes. Submesoscale processes are particularly relevant to phytoplankton productivity because the timescales on which they act are similar to those of phytoplankton growth. Their dynamics are associated with strong vorticity and strain rates that occur on lateral scales of 0.1-10 km. They can support vertical velocities as large as 100 m d(-1) and play a crucial role in transporting nutrients into the sunlit ocean for phytoplankton production. In regimes with deep surface mixed layers, submesoscale instabilities can cause stratification within days, thereby increasing light exposure for phytoplankton trapped close to the surface. These instabilities help to create and maintain localized environments that favor the growth of phytoplankton, contribute to productivity, and cause enormous heterogeneity in the abundance of phytoplankton, which has implications for interactions within the ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {The ocean is a dynamic environment inhabited by a diverse array of highly migratory species, many of which are under direct exploitation in targeted fisheries. The time- scales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and eco- logical forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990--2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the Cali- fornia drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence--absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regio- nal Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Sword- fish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters ({\textgreater}1,500 m) with surface temperatures in the 14--20$\,^{\circ}$C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20--40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon ({\textless}20{\%} lunar illumination).We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence--absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotempo- rally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.},

	Abstract = {An algorithm is described for oceanic front detection in chlorophyll (Chl) and sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery. The algorithm is based on a gradient approach: the main novelty is a shape-preserving, scale-sensitive, contextual median filter applied selectively and iteratively until convergence. This filter has been developed specifically for Chl since these fields have spatial patterns such as chlorophyll enhancement at thermohaline fronts and small- and meso-scale chlorophyll blooms that are not present in SST fields. Linear Chl enhancements and localized (point-wise) blooms are modeled as ridges and peaks respectively, whereas conventional fronts in Chl and SST fields are modeled as steps or ramps. Examples are presented of the algorithm performance using modeled (synthetic) images as well as synoptic Chl and SST imagery. After testing, the algorithm was used on {\textgreater} 6000 synoptic images, 1999-2007, to produce climatologies of Chl and SST fronts off the U.S. Northeast. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {An accurate knowledge of the ocean mean dynamic topography (MDT) is mandatory for the optimal use of altimetric data, including their assimilation into operational ocean forecasting systems. A new global 1/4� resolution MDT was computed for the 1993{\&}{\#}8211;1999 time period with improved data and methodology compared to the previous RIO05 MDT field. First, a large-scale MDT is obtained from the CLS01 altimetric Mean Sea Surface and a recent geoid model computed from 4.5 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data. Altimetric sea level anomalies and in situ measurements are then combined to compute synthetic estimates of the MDT and the corresponding mean currents. While the RIO05 MDT was based on 10 years of in situ dynamic heights and drifting buoy velocities, the new field benefits from an enlarged data set of in situ measurements ranging from 1993 to 2008 and includes all hydrological profiles from the Argo array. Moreover, the processing of the in situ data has been updated. A new Ekman model was developed to extract the geostrophic velocity component from the drifting buoy measurements. The handling of hydrologic measurements has also been revisited. Compared to the previous RIO05 solution, the new global MDT resolves much stronger gradients in western boundary currents, with mean velocities being doubled in some places. Moreover, in comparison to several other recent MDT estimates, we find that the new CNES-CLS09 MDT is in better agreement with independent in situ observations.},

Here we report results from a field campaign from March 2014 that captured the eddy effects on mode-water subduction south of the Kuroshio Extension east of Japan. The experiment deployed 17 Argo floats in an anticyclonic eddy (AC) with enhanced daily sampling. Analysis of over 3,000 hydrographic profiles following the AC reveals that potential vorticity and apparent oxygen utilization distributions are asymmetric outside the AC core, with enhanced subduction near the southeastern rim of the AC. There, the southward eddy flow advects newly ventilated mode water from the north into the main thermocline. Our results show that subduction by eddy lateral advection is comparable in magnitude to that by the mean flow---an effect that needs to be better represented in climate models.},

	Abstract = {We analysed relationships between demersal fish species richness, environment and trawl characteristics using an extensive collection of trawl data from the oceans around New Zealand. Analyses were carried out using both generalised additive models and boosted regression trees (sometimes referred to as 'stochastic gradient boosting'). Depth was the single most important environmental predictor of variation in species richness, with highest richness occurring at depths of 900 to 1000 m, and with a broad plateau of moderately high richness between 400 and 1100 m. Richness was higher both in waters with high surface concentrations of chlorophyll a and in zones of mixing of water bodies of contrasting origins. Local variation in temperature was also important, with lower richness occurring in waters that were cooler than expected given their depth. Variables describing trawl length, trawl speed, and cod-end mesh size made a substantial contribution to analysis outcomes, even though functions fitted for trawl distance and cod-end mesh size were constrained to reflect the known performance of trawl gear. Species richness declined with increasing cod-end mesh size and increasing trawl speed, but increased with increasing trawl distance, reaching a plateau once trawl distances exceed about 3 nautical miles. Boosted regression trees provided a powerful analysis tool, giving substantially superior predictive performance to generalized additive models, despite the fitting of interaction terms in the latter.},

	Abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the influence of the ocean circulation at different spatiotemporal scales on the seasonal distribution of a large marine predator, the Mediterranean fin whale, by comparing multisatellite data with the positions of eight fin whales equipped with Argos tracking devices from August 2003 to June 2004. At the western Mediterranean basin scale, fin whales were associated with the anticlockwise gyre in the northern part of the western Mediterranean Sea, which defines the habitat of krill, the whales' main prey. At mesoscale and submesoscale, and only during the seasonal phytoplankton biomass minimum in summer, whales exhibited a preference for the periphery of eddies and they were often associated with filaments indicative of submesoscale fronts. Timescales of these mesoscale and submesoscale features are comparable with the ecological timescales of the lower levels of the trophic chain. Whales were not associated to productive areas, probably due to the spatiotemporal lag between phytoplankton and krill. Our results suggest that stirring by eddies may create filaments that are favorable foraging grounds for predators searching for aggregated prey during the most oligotrophic period of the year.},

We used a range of ecosystem models to explore the effects of fishing low{\^{a}}€``trophic level species on marine ecosystems, including marine mammals and seabirds, and on other commercially important species. In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80{\%} of MSY.},

	Abstract = {The export of particulate organic carbon (POC) from the surface ocean to depth is traditionally ascribed to sinking. Here, we show that a dynamic eddying flow field subducts surface water with high concentrations of nonsinking POC. Autonomous observations made by gliders during the North Atlantic spring bloom reveal anomalous features at depths of 100 to 350 meters with elevated POC, chlorophyll, oxygen, and temperature-salinity characteristics of surface water. High-resolution modeling reveals that during the spring transition, intrusions of POC-rich surface water descend as coherent, 1- to 10-kilometer-scale filamentous features, often along the perimeter of eddies. Such a submesoscale eddy-driven flux of POC is unresolved in global carbon cycle models but can contribute as much as half of the total springtime export of POC from the highly productive subpolar oceans.},

Although there is increasing support for marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool for pelagic conservation, there have also been numerous criticisms of the ecological, logistical and economic feasibility of place-based management in the dynamic pelagic environment. Here we argue that recent advances across conservation, oceanography and fisheries science provide the evidence, tools and information to address these criticisms and confirm MPAs as defensible and feasible instruments for pelagic conservation. Debate over the efficacy of protected areas relative to other conservation measures cannot be resolved without further implementation of MPAs in the pelagic ocean. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {To analyze the effects of mesoscale eddies, sea surface temperature (SST), and gear configuration on the catch of Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the U.S. northwest Atlantic longline fishery, we constructed multivariate statistical models relating these variables to the catch of the four species in 62 121 longline hauls made between 1993 and 2005. During the same 13-year period, 103 anticyclonic eddies and 269 cyclonic eddies were detected by our algorithm in the region 30-55$\,^{\circ}$N, 30-80$\,^{\circ}$W. Our results show that tuna and swordfish catches were associated with different eddy structures. Bluefin tuna catch was highest in anticyclonic eddies whereas yellowfin and bigeye tuna catches were highest in cyclonic eddies. Swordfish catch was found preferentially in regions outside of eddies. Our study confirms that the common practice of targeting tuna with day sets and swordfish with night sets is effective. In addition, bluefin tuna and swordfish catches responded to most of the variables we tested in the opposite directions. Bluefin tuna catch was negatively correlated with longitude and the number of light sticks used whereas swordfish catch was positively correlated with these two variables. We argue that overfishing of bluefin tuna can be alleviated and that swordfish can be targeted more efficiently by avoiding fishing in anticyclonic eddies and in near-shore waters and using more light sticks and fishing at night in our study area, although further studies are needed to propose a solid oceanography-based management plan for catch selection. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley},

@article{TewKai2010,
	Abstract = {Mesoscale physical features as fronts and eddies appear to play a key role in the dynamics of marine communities. In the Indian Ocean, the Mozambique Channel (MC) is a natural laboratory to investigate mesoscale eddies (100-300 km in diameter); indeed, four to seven eddies per year are know to transit through the Channel, from North to South. We studied the structuring role of the mesoscale eddies on spatial dynamics and foraging strategy of top predators using seabirds and tuna as examples. Emphasis was on the central part of the MC (16-24$\,^{\circ}$S) where eddy activity is most developed. We integrated three main categories of information: (i) satellite altimetry for sea-level anomaly (SLA) and geostrophic current, remotely-sensed surface temperature (SST) and SeaWiFS data for chlorophyll concentration (CC); (ii) individual tracking of Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) to characterize foraging areas; and (iii) detailed catch statistics from purse-seine fisheries to describe distribution of tuna schools. Generalized Additive Models were applied to quantify the relative influence of mesoscale descriptors, SST and CC on foraging behaviour of Great Frigatebirds and location of purse-seine sets. Our results show that seabirds are more closely tied to mesoscale eddies compared to tuna. We underline the role of eddy boundaries on the response of frigatebirds and tuna. Good foraging conditions are promoted along the edge of eddies as a result of the interplay of the maturation process from cyclonic eddies and the concentration process by eddy interactions. A decrease in the number or intensity of eddies in the MC, as observed during strong El Ni{\~{n}}o events, could potentially affect the eddy-related ecosystem with putative negative repercussions on central-place foragers such as Great Frigatebirds. We discuss the importance of a better understanding of the "eddy system", in marine conservation and tuna fisheries management in the Mozambique Channel. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {After the breeding season, penguins must replenish body condition and accumulate sufficient energy stores before their annual moult ashore; failure to do so may lead to starvation. Knowing where and how adult penguins find adequate resources during this energy-intensive stage is vital to understanding their susceptibility to ecosystem changes. GPS and TDR loggers were used to track movements and record diving behaviour of macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus and eastern rockhopper E. chrysocome filholi penguins from Marion Island (46$\,^{\circ}$S, 37$\,^{\circ}$E) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Both species consistently travelled in a southerly direction to forage in cooler ({\~{}}3.5 $\,^{\circ}$C) Antarctic Zone waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front where they associated with mesoscale eddies and sub-mesoscale filaments. Dives were predominantly to depths of 30 to 60 m, but macaroni penguins dived deeper more often. Mean trip durations of both species were similar (33 $\pm$ 6 days), but maximum foraging ranges of macaroni penguins (903 $\pm$ 165 km) were greater than eastern rockhopper penguins (696 $\pm$ 152 km). Spatial overlap of core foraging areas between species was high, but a 2- to 3-week difference in departure dates reduced potential interspecific competition at sea. Trip durations were longer in 2014 compared to 2013, when decreased productivity may have reduced prey availability, forcing penguins to remain longer at sea. Continued monitoring is vital to understand how crested penguins at Marion Island adapt to the predicted southward shift of major frontal boundaries.},

	Abstract = {Spatial structuring and segregation by sex and size is considered to be an intrinsic attribute of shark populations. These spatial patterns remain poorly understood, particularly for oceanic species such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), despite its importance for the management and conservation of this highly migratory species. This study presents the results of a long-term electronic tagging experiment to investigate the migratory patterns of blue shark, to elucidate how these patterns change across its life history and to assess the existence of a nursery area in the central North Atlantic. Blue sharks belonging to different life stages (n = 34) were tracked for periods up to 952 days during which they moved extensively (up to an estimated 28.139 km), occupying large parts of the oceanic basin. Notwithstanding a large individual variability, there were pronounced differences in movements and space use across the species' life history. The study provides strong evidence for the existence of a discrete central North Atlantic nursery, where juveniles can reside for up to at least 2 years. In contrast with previously described nurseries of coastal and semi-pelagic sharks, this oceanic nursery is comparatively vast and open suggesting that shelter from predators is not its main function. Subsequently, male and female blue sharks spatially segregate. Females engage in seasonal latitudinal migrations until approaching maturity, when they undergo an ontogenic habitat shift towards tropical latitudes. In contrast, juvenile males generally expanded their range southward and apparently displayed a higher degree of behavioural polymorphism. These results provide important insights into the spatial ecology of pelagic sharks, with implications for the sustainable management of this heavily exploited shark, especially in the central North Atlantic where the presence of a nursery and the seasonal overlap and alternation of different life stages coincides with a high fishing mortality.},

	Abstract = {An optimal search theory, the so-called L{\'{e}}vy-flight foraging hypothesis, predicts that predators should adopt search strategies known as L{\'{e}}vy flights where prey is sparse and distributed unpredictably, but that Brownian movement is sufficiently efficient for locating abundant prey. Empirical studies have generated controversy because the accuracy of statistical methods that have been used to identify L{\'{e}}vy behaviour has recently been questioned. Consequently, whether foragers exhibit L{\'{e}}vy flights in the wild remains unclear. Crucially, moreover, it has not been tested whether observed movement patterns across natural landscapes having different expected resource distributions conform to the theory's central predictions. Here we use maximum-likelihood methods to test for L{\'{e}}vy patterns in relation to environmental gradients in the largest animal movement data set assembled for this purpose. Strong support was found for L{\'{e}}vy search patterns across 14 species of open-ocean predatory fish (sharks, tuna, billfish and ocean sunfish), with some individuals switching between L{\'{e}}vy and Brownian movement as they traversed different habitat types. We tested the spatial occurrence of these two principal patterns and found L{\'{e}}vy behaviour to be associated with less productive waters (sparser prey) and Brownian movements to be associated with productive shelf or convergence-front habitats (abundant prey). These results are consistent with the L{\'{e}}vy-flight foraging hypothesis, supporting the contention that organism search strategies naturally evolved in such a way that they exploit optimal L{\'{e}}vy patterns.},

	Abstract = {Satellite-tracking of mature white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) has revealed open-ocean movements spanning months and covering tens of thousands of kilometers. But how are the energetic demands of these active apex predators met as they leave coastal areas with relatively high prey abundance to swim across the open ocean through waters often characterized as biological deserts? Here we investigate mesoscale oceanographic variability encountered by two white sharks as they moved through the Gulf Stream region and Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the vicinity of the Gulf Stream, the two mature female white sharks exhibited extensive use of the interiors of clockwise-rotating anticyclonic eddies, characterized by positive (warm) temperature anomalies. One tagged white shark was also equipped with an archival tag that indicated this individual made frequent dives to nearly 1,000 m in anticyclones, where it was presumably foraging on mesopelagic prey. We propose that warm temperature anomalies in anticyclones make prey more accessible and energetically profitable to adult white sharks in the Gulf Stream region by reducing the physiological costs of thermoregulation in cold water. The results presented here provide valuable new insight into open ocean habitat use by mature, female white sharks that may be applicable to other large pelagic predators.},

	Abstract = {Satellite telemetry of 43 juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the western North Pacific together with satellite-remotely sensed oceanographic data identified the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation Region (KEBR) as a forage hotspot for these turtles. In the KEBR juvenile loggerheads resided in Kuroshio Extension Current (KEC) meanders and the associated anti-cyclonic (warm core) and cyclonic (cold core) eddies during the fall, winter, and spring when the KEC water contains high surface chlorophyll. Turtles often remained at a specific feature for several months. However, in the summer when the KEC waters become vertically stratified and surface chlorophyll levels are low, the turtles moved north up to 600 km from the main axis of KEC to the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF). In some instances, the loggerheads swam against geostrophic currents, and seasonally all turtles moved north and south across the strong zonal flow. Loggerhead turtles traveling westward in the KEBR had their directed westward movement reduced 50{\%} by the opposing current, while those traveling eastward exhibited an increase in directed zonal movement. It appears, therefore, that these relatively weak-swimming juvenile loggerheads are not passive drifters in a major ocean current but are able to move east, west, north, and south through this very energetic and complex habitat. These results indicate that oceanic regions, specifically the KEBR, represent an important juvenile forage habitat for this threatened species. Interannual and decadal changes in productivity of the KEBR may be important to the species's population dynamics. Further, conservation efforts should focus on identifying and reducing threats to the survival of loggerhead turtles in the KEBR. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Background: Blue sharks (Prionace glauca) are among the most abundant and widely distributed of oceanic elasmobranchs. Millions are taken annually in pelagic longline fisheries and comprise the highest component of auctioned fin weight in the international shark fin trade. Though studies of blue sharks outnumber those of other large pelagic sharks, the species' complicated and sexually segregated life history still confound current understanding of Atlantic movement patterns. Lack of detailed information regarding movement and vertical behavior continues to limit management efforts that require such data for stock assessment and sustainable catch modeling. Therefore, this study aims to describe behavioral and ecological patterns distinct to aggregating and migrating blue sharks, and compare the findings to existing Atlantic movement models. Results: Data collected from 23 blue sharks instrumented with pop-up satellite archival tags were used in statistical predictive regression models to investigate habitat use during a localized aggregation in the northwest Atlantic, while undergoing seasonal migrations, and with respect to environmental variables. Deployment durations ranged from 4 to 273 days, with sharks inhabiting both productive coastal waters and the open ocean, and exhibiting long-distance seasonal movements exceeding 3700 km. While aggregating on the continental shelf of the northwest Atlantic, blue sharks displayed consistent depth use independent of sex and life stage, and exhibited varied response to environmental (temperature and chlorophyll a) factors. As sharks dispersed from the aggregation site, depth use was influenced by bathymetry, latitude, demography, and presence in the Gulf Stream. Mature females were not observed at the New England tagging site, however, two mature females with recent mating wounds were captured and tagged opportunistically in The Bahamas, one of which migrated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Conclusions: Vertical behaviors displayed by blue sharks varied greatly among locales; depth use off the continental shelf was significantly greater, and individuals exhibited a greater frequency of deep-diving behavior, compared to periods of aggregation on the continental shelf. Sexual segregation was evident, suggesting mature and immature males, and immature females may be subjected to high levels of anthropogenic exploitation in this region during periods of aggregation. Analysis of the spatio-temporal tracks revealed that nine individuals traveled beyond the United States EEZ, including a mature female captured in The Bahamas that migrated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These results reflect and augment existing Atlantic migration models, and highlight the complex, synergistic nature of factors affecting blue shark ecology and the need for a cooperative management approach in the North Atlantic.},

	Abstract = {Meso- and submesoscales (fronts, eddies, filaments) in surface ocean flow have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics partly control the foraging behavior and the displacement of marine top predators (tuna, birds, turtles, and cetaceans). In this work we focus on the role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird. Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs. The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric current changes over the structures to move along these biologic corridors. The birds being often associated with tuna schools around foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of their foraging behavior and movement during the breeding season is crucial not only to seabird ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach to fisheries in the channel.},

	Abstract = {Interconnections between the physical, biological and chemical processes that regulate carbon cycling in the ocean span a tremendous range of space and time scales. A particularly strong manifestation of these linkages occurs at the oceanic mesoscale, sometimes referred to as the "internal weather of the sea." Highly energetic currents, fronts and eddies are ubiquitous features of ocean circulation, with characteristic spatial scales of 10-100 km and temporal scales of weeks to months. Their space scales are thus smaller and time scales longer than their counterparts in atmospheric weather, but the dynamics of the two systems are in many ways analogous. Both are characterized by large-amplitude departures from mean conditions on relatively small spatial scales, over relatively short periods of time. Mesoscale phenomena include a diverse set of physical, chemical and biological interactions that influence the distribution and variability of the biogeochemical constituents of the water column. Complex yet highly organized flows continually deform and rearrange the hydrographic structure of the near-surface waters in which plankton reside. These motions affect biogeochemical cycling in two major ways: they alter distributions via the movement of water masses, and they modulate the rates of chemical and biological processes. Common manifestations of the second factor are associated with vertical transport, which can  affect the availability of both nutrients and light to phytoplankton and therefore the rate of primary production. The dynamics of mesoscale and submesoscale flows are replete with mechanisms that can produce vertical motions, thereby modulating the efficacy of the biological pump. in essence, there are two aspects of mesoscale physical-biogeochemical coupling that have major implications for the study of global ocean fluxes. First, unless observations are specifically designed to deal with mesoscale variability, spatial variations propagating through an area can be mistaken for temporal variability in that area. Second, mesoscale dynamic processes themselves can drive significant fluxes that affect local, regional and basin-scale biogeochemical budgets. Examples of both issues will be highlighted in the following brief overview of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) process studies and timeseries programs.},

	Abstract = {We examined the mesoscale distribution of zooplankton populations using a continuous recording system: the optical plankton counter (OPC). Data were collected in the mid-latitude northeast Atlantic inter-gyre region in April and September 2001 during the POMME 2 and POMME 3 cruises. This sector of the North Atlantic system is characterized by subduction phenomena and mesoscale eddies. Estimated mean biomass was 2.88 DW g m-2 in April and 1.64 DW g m-2 in September with populations dominated by small copepods of the genera, Clausocalanus, Paracalanus and Oithona. Day-night changes in vertical distribution appeared to be seasonally variable. During April, absolute concentrations within the upper layer above 50 m were higher at night. During September, vertical profiles of relative biomass were quite similar for day and night. Highest depth-integrated biomasses were located mainly on the periphery of anticyclonic eddies, with maxima related to the increase in depth range of vertical distribution. This pattern suggested that maximum biomass was associated with the most dynamic parts of the frontal features. Other zones of high zooplankton biomass were associated with the centers of cyclonic eddies and high fluorescence values. Using a 3D view, we found that zooplankton distribution showed a more complex pattern than in a 2D view with variable vertical distribution. Hence, proper description of the distribution of zooplankton underlines the need to describe this submesoscale with an order of magnitude around 10 nautical miles. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The oceanographic drivers of marine vertebrate habitat use are poorly understood yet fundamental to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. Here, we use composite front mapping and high-resolution GPS tracking to determine the significance of mesoscale oceanographic fronts as physical drivers of foraging habitat selection in northern gannets Morus bassanus. We tracked 66 breeding gannets from a Celtic Sea colony over 2 years and used residence time to identify area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. Composite front maps identified thermal and chlorophyll-a mesoscale fronts at two different temporal scales-(i) contemporaneous fronts and (ii) seasonally persistent frontal zones. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), with generalized estimating equations (GEE-GAMs) to account for serial autocorrelation in tracking data, we found that gannets do not adjust their behaviour in response to contemporaneous fronts. However, ARS was more likely to occur within spatially predictable, seasonally persistent frontal zones (GAMs). Our results provide proof of concept that composite front mapping is a useful tool for studying the influence of oceanographic features on animal movements. Moreover, we highlight that frontal persistence is a crucial element of the formation of pelagic foraging hotspots for mobile marine vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {Mesoscale phenomena are ubiquitous and highly energetic features of ocean circulation. Their influence on biological and biogeochemical processes varies widely, stemming not only from advective transport but also from the generation of variations in the environment that affect biological and chemical rates. The ephemeral nature of mesoscale features in the ocean makes it difficult to elucidate the attendant mechanisms of physical-biological-biogeochemical interaction, necessitating the use of multidisciplinary approaches involving in situ observations, remote sensing, and modeling. All three aspects are woven through this review in an attempt to synthesize current understanding of the topic, with particular emphasis on novel developments in recent years.

	Abstract = {Explanations for the patchy distribution of marine phytoplankton are critically reviewed with the focus on the role played by lateral advection and mixing. Generating mechanisms for what is increasingly seen as a ubiquitous feature of the oceans have been sought in biology, behaviour, population dynamics, physics and various combinations thereof. As the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale (1-500 km) contain the "weather" of the ocean--eddies and fronts capable of strong stirring and mixing of any tracers advected by them--the physical circulation in this regime may have a strong role in the generation of patchiness. As a consequence, the focus here is on the ways the turbulent currents at these scales can interact with other processes to produce the complex spatial structures in phytoplankton distributions seen in countless satellite images and cruise data. The mechanisms reviewed include patch formation (KiSS theory), filamentation, Turing and related instabilities, diffusion waves, shear effects and turbulent stirring. Parallel to this is a discussion of observations and of the techniques that have been used to analyse them, particularly spectral analysis. It will be seen that many of the limitations in extant theories stem from a paucity of data and ambiguity in its interpretation. A synthesis of recent developments in sampling, instrumentation, image analysis and turbulence theory is used to suggest alternatives to conventional approaches, to highlight important work in related fields and to motivate new lines of research.},

	Abstract = {Many species undertake long-distance annual migrations between foraging and reproductive areas. Such migrants depend on the efficient packaging, storage and utilization of energy to succeed. A diverse assemblage of organisms accomplishes this through the use of lipid reserves; yet, it remains unclear whether the migrations of elasmobranchs, which include the largest gill breathers on Earth, depend on such a mechanism. We examine depth records from pop-up satellite archival tags to discern changes in buoyancy as a proxy for energy storage in Eastern Pacific white sharks, and assess whether lipid depletion fuels long-distance (approx. 4000 km) migrations. We develop new algorithms to assess body condition, buoyancy and drift rate during drift dives and validate the techniques using a captive white shark. In the wild, we document a consistent increase in drift rate over the course of all migrations, indicating a decrease in buoyancy caused by the depletion of lipid reserves. These results comprise, to our knowledge, the first assessment of energy storage and budgeting in migrating sharks. The methods provide a basis for further insights into using electronic tags to reveal the energetic strategies of a wide range of elasmobranchs.},

	Abstract = {Recent Studies have applied state-space models to satellite telemetry data in order to remove noise from raw location estimates and infer the true tracks of animals. However, while the resulting tracks May appear plausible, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the estimated positions, especially for position estimates interpolated to times between satellite locations. In this study, we use data from two gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) carrying, tags that transmitted Fastloc GPS positions via Argos satellites. This combination of Service Argos data and highly accurate GPS data allowed examination of the accuracy of state-space position estimates and their uncertainty derived from satellite telemetry data After applying a speed filter to remove aberrant satellite telemetry locations. we fit a continuous-time Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of I random walk, used Kalman smoothing to infer positions at the times of the GPS Measurements. and then compared the filtered telemetry estimates with the actual GPS Measurements. We investigated the effect of varying maximum speed thresholds in the speed-filtering algorithm oil the root mean-square error (RMSE) estimates and used minimum RMSE as a criterion to guide the final choice of speed threshold. The optimal speed thresholds differed between the two animals (1.1 m/s and 2.5 m/s) and retained 50{\%} and 65{\%} of the data for each seal. However, using a speed filter of 1.1 m/s resulted in very similar RMSE for both animals. For the two seals. the RMSE of the Kalman-filtered estimates of location were 5.9 and 12.76 km, respectively, and 75{\%} of the modeled positions had errors less than 6.25 km and 11.7 km for each seal. Confidence interval coverage was close to correct at typical levels (80-95{\%}), although it tended to be overly generous at smaller sizes. The reliability Of uncertainty estimates was also affected by the chosen sliced threshold. The combination of sliced and Kalman filtering allows for effective calculation of location and also indicates the limits of accuracy when correcting service Argos locations and linking satellite telemetry data to spatial covariate and habitat data.},

	Abstract = {* Analyses of animal resource selection functions (RSF) using data collected from relocations of individuals via remote telemetry devices have become commonplace. Increasing technological advances, however, have produced statistical challenges in analysing such highly autocorrelated data. Weighted distribution methods have been proposed for analysing RSFs with telemetry data. However, they can be computationally challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant and cannot be aggregated (i.e. collapsed) over time to make space-only inference. * In this study, we take a conceptually different approach to modelling animal telemetry data for making RSF inference. We consider the telemetry data to be a realization of a space--time point process. Under the point process paradigm, the times of the relocations are also considered to be random rather than fixed. * We show the point process models we propose are a generalization of the weighted distribution telemetry models. By generalizing the weighted model, we can access several numerical techniques for evaluating point process likelihoods that make use of common statistical software. Thus, the analysis methods can be readily implemented by animal ecologists. * In addition to ease of computation, the point process models can be aggregated over time by marginalizing over the temporal component of the model. This allows a full range of models to be constructed for RSF analysis at the individual movement level up to the study area level. * To demonstrate the analysis of telemetry data with the point process approach, we analysed a data set of telemetry locations from northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. Both a space--time and an aggregated space-only model were fitted. At the individual level, the space--time analysis showed little selection relative to the habitat covariates. However, at the study area level, the space-only model showed strong selection relative to the covariates.},

	Abstract = {Habitat selection is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology, the understanding of which is critical to management and conservation. Global positioning system data from animals allow fine-scale assessments of habitat selection and typically are analyzed in a use-- availability framework, whereby animal locations are contrasted with random locations (the availability sample). Although most use--availability methods are in fact spatial point process models, they often are fit using logistic regression. This framework offers numerous methodological challenges, for which the literature provides little guidance. Specifically, the size and spatial extent of the availability sample influences coefficient estimates potentially causing interpretational bias. We examined the influence of availability on statistical inference through simulations and analysis of serially correlated mule deer GPS data. Bias in estimates arose from incorrectly assessing and sampling the spatial extent of availability. Spatial autocorrelation in covariates, which is common for landscape characteristics, exacerbated the error in availability sampling leading to increased bias. These results have strong implications for habitat selection analyses using GPS data, which are increasingly prevalent in the literature. We recommend that researchers assess the sensitivity of their results to their availability sample and, where bias is likely, take care with interpretations and use cross validation to assess robustness},

	Abstract = {Cetacean--habitat modeling, although still in the early stages of development, represents a potentially powerful tool for predicting cetacean distributions and understanding the ecological processes determining these distributions. Marine ecosystems vary temporally on diel to decadal scales and spatially on scales from several meters to 1000s of kilometers. Many cetacean species are wideranging and respond to this variability by changes in distribution patterns. Cetacean--habitat models have already been used to incorporate this variability into management applications, including improvement of abundance estimates, development of marine protected areas, and understanding cetacean--fisheries interactions. We present a review of the development of cetacean--habitat models, organized according to the primary steps involved in the modeling process. Topics covered include purposes for which cetacean--habitat models are developed, scale issues in marine ecosystems, cetacean and habitat data collection, descriptive and statistical modeling techniques, model selection, and model evaluation. To date, descriptive statistical techniques have been used to explore cetacean--habitat relationships for selected species in specific areas; the numbers of species and geographic areas examined using computationally intensive statistic modeling techniques are considerably less, and the development of models to test specific hypotheses about the ecological processes determining cetacean distributions has just begun. Future directions in cetacean--habitat modeling span a wide range of possibilities, from development of basic modeling techniques to addressing important ecological questions.},

The target binary mask can only be calculated under ideal conditions and will contain errors when estimated in real-life applications. This paper proposes a method for correcting these errors. The error-correction is based on a hidden Markov model and uses the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the most probable error-free target binary mask from a target binary mask containing errors. The results demonstrate that it is possible to correct errors in the target binary mask and reduce the noise energy. However, speech energy is also reduced by the error-correction, but the impact on speech intelligibility and speech quality are not established or evaluated in the present study.},

	Abstract = {The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {\textless}1{\%} of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

	Abstract = {    * Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.   * Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.   * Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.   * ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed.   * We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.  },

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible. To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs, enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks. Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50{\%} of the time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90{\%} of the time, for above, equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively. With geolocation data, 50{\%} of errors were less than 104.8 km ({\textless}0.94$\,^{\circ}$), and 90{\%} were less than 199.8 km ({\textless}1.80$\,^{\circ}$). Larger errors were due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude. The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive utilization in future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Highly pelagic large marine vertebrates have evolved the capability of moving across large expanses of the marine environment; some species routinely move across entire ocean basins. Our understanding of these movements has been enhanced by new technologies that now allow us to follow their movements over great distances and long time periods in great detail. This technology provides not only detailed information on the movements of a wide variety of marine species, but also detailed characteristics of the habitats they use and clues to their navigation abilities. Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

	Abstract = {Detailed observation of the movement of individual animals offers the potential to understand spatial population processes as the ultimate consequence of individual behaviour, physiological constraints and fine-scale environmental influences. However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

@article{Wakefield2009,
	Abstract = {Colonial seabirds are relatively easy to observe, count, measure and manipulate, and consequently have long been used as models for testing ecological hypotheses. A combination of animal tracking and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird movements are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light-based geolocation, while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of characterizing the millions of km(2) of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be considered: this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are central place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spatial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be modeled as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects generalized additive models), At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.},

	Abstract = {Current lightbased geolocation techniques used to identify migration routes of highly mobile species have inherent limitations, depending on the type of tag technologies used. Recovered data storage tags provide detailed time series of light-levels suited for extensive post-processing, while pop-up satellite tags (PSATs) are bandwidth-limited and generally provide samples only at critical times of the day. An alternative approach is to detect a sunrise or sunset event and transmit only this information, thus freeing bandwidth for depth or temperature data. We show here that this geolocation technique retains the essential information to correct for known problems such as errors at the equinoxes. We describe the suitable model for such data, as well as the behavior of resulting location error and bias in simulated cases. Illustrations from PSAT tags at the ocean's surface and on a freely-swimming fish reveal a highly non-Gaussian error distribution. To solve for this, we present a more generalized estimation framework than linear Gaussian models, based on an extension of the Kalman filter. We apply iterative nonlinear Least squares to address non-Gaussian errors, non-linear dynamics and missing data. The proposed optimization method may include coastlines or bathymetric limits as hard constraints. Our results indicate that sunrise/sunset-based geolocation is a viable technique technique to surmount tag design or engineering limitations when tracking pelagic fish},

There are many existing techniques for handling location error, but these are often ad hoc or are used in isolation from each other. In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools.},

Data returned from these efforts (n = 26 PSATs, 1 archival tag) revealed their dispersal routes, horizontal and vertical movements and habitat utilization. All of the tagged bluefin tuna remained in the northwest Atlantic for the duration observed, and in summer months exhibited core-use of coastal seas extending from Maryland to Cape Cod, MA, (USA) out to the shelf break. Their winter distributions were more spatially disaggregated, ranging south to the South Atlantic Bight, northern Bahamas and Gulf Stream. Vertical habitat patterns showed that juvenile bluefin tuna mainly occupied shallow depths (mean = 5-12 m, sd = 15-23.7 m) and relatively warm water masses in summer (mean = 17.9-20.9 degrees C, sd = 4.2-2.6 degrees C) and had deeper and more variable depth patterns in winter (mean = 41-58 m, sd = 48.9-62.2 m). Our tagging results reveal annual dispersal patterns, behavior and oceanographic associations of juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna that were only surmised in earlier studies. Fishery independent profiling from electronic tagging also provide spatially and temporally explicit information for evaluating dispersals rates, population structure and fisheries catch patterns.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary Animal space use and movements are best understood through direct observation. This chapter describes a variety of techniques used to analyze animal space use, including home range estimation, analysis of site fidelity, and animal interactions. It also provides limitations of using many traditional techniques. The chapter provides a discussion of modeling animal movements using a combination of advanced descriptive and visualization approaches, general movement models, and biological models. The importance of sample size and autocorrelation of data in estimating home ranges and animal movements cannot be overemphasized. When considering tradeoffs between sample size and independence, obtaining an adequate sample size is more important than independence between data points. Any analysis of radiotelemetry data must consider the full range of biological and environmental factors that may impact the results. Home range estimation and animal movement analyses must answer difficult questions regarding the internal anatomy of home range boundaries and movement pathways through the judicious use of biological and environmental information. Also, radiotelemetry studies should go beyond simple, general descriptions and use a model-driven approach to examine the key factors determining why and how an animal uses space.},

Inter-individual variation in migration propensity affects population dynamics and connectivity. The diversity of migratory behaviours of Atlantic cod (fork length {\textgreater}40 cm) in the northern Gulf of St Lawrence was studied using data-storage tags that record depth and temperature. Movement patterns of Atlantic cod equipped with data-storage tags were reconstructed using a geolocation model based on daily maximum depth and bottom temperature. Reconstructed migration routes revealed the previously undocumented coexistence of resident and migratory individuals in the population. Migratory cod overwintered in relatively deep (300--500 m) and warm (5$\,^{\circ}$C) waters, while residents displayed a prolonged period of immobility in shallow ({\textless}100 m) and near-freezing (--1.5$\,^{\circ}$C) coastal waters of western Newfoundland. In the spring, migratory cod displayed extensive diel vertical migration suggestive of spawning behaviour. The presence of alternative migratory behaviours should be considered in the spatiotemporal management of the collapsed population.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Satellite telemetry data have substantially increased our understanding of habitat use and foraging behaviour of upper-trophic marine predators, but fall short of providing an understanding of their social behaviour. We sought to determine whether novel acoustic and archival GPS data could be used to examine at-sea associations among grey seals ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Halichoerus grypus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) during the fall foraging period. Fifteen grey seals from Sable Island, Canada were deployed with Vemco Mobile Transceivers and Satellite-GPS transmitters in October 2009, 13 of which were recaptured and units retrieved 79$\pm$2.3 days later during the following breeding season, December 2009--January 2010. An association between two individuals was defined as a cluster of acoustic detections where the time between detections was {\textless}30 min. Bathymetry, travel rate, and behavioural state (slow and fast movement) were determined for each GPS archival point (3.7$\pm$0.1 locations recorded per hour). Behavioural state was estimated using a hidden Markov model. All seals had been involved in associations with other instrumented seals while at sea, with a total of 1,872 acoustic detections recorded in 201 associations. The median number of detections per association was 3 (range: 1--151) and the median duration of an association was 0.17 h (range: {\textless}0.1--11.3 h). Linear mixed-effects models showed that associations occurred when seals were exhibiting slow movement (0.24$\pm$0.01 ms{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) on shallow (53.4$\pm$3.7 m) offshore banks where dominant prey is known to occur. These results suggest the occurrence of short-term associations among multiple individuals at foraging grounds and provide new insights into the foraging ecology of this upper-trophic marine predator.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are now widely used to document the geographic and vertical movements of large pelagic fishes. These instruments record measurements of ambient light, depth and temperature at regular intervals and the light data are used to compute daily estimates of latitude and longitude. Several methods have been developed to improve those estimates, including the application of Kalman filter models and matching sea surface temperatures (SST) from tags with remotely sensed SSTs. Despite their widespread use, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques. To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location provided by the PSATs was 5.16$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and 2.00$\,^{\circ}$ longitude. Estimates were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE = 2.97$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and 0.78$\,^{\circ}$ longitude) and most accurate after processing with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE = 1.84$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and 0.78$\,^{\circ}$ longitude). We also assessed the precision of the PSAT-derived locations, and depth and temperature measurements by comparing the data from the two PSATs. Our findings support the use of archival tag data to reconstruct the large-scale movements of marine animals and demonstrate the significant improvements that may result from two refinement techniques.},

@article{Mueller2008a,
	Abstract = {    1     Temporal variability in habitat suitability has important conservation and ecological implications. In grasslands, changes in resource availability can occur at broad spatial scales and enlarge area requirements of ungulate populations, which increases their vulnerability to habitat loss and fragmentation. Understanding and predicting these dynamics, although critical, has received little attention so far.     2     We investigated habitat dynamics for Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa Pallas) in the eastern steppes of Mongolia. We quantified the distribution of gazelles at four different time periods and tracked primary productivity using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from satellite imagery.     3     A second-order logistic model showed that NDVI was an efficient predictor of gazelle presence. We tested the predictive power of the model with independent data from a gazelle telemetry study: 85{\%} of all relocations were found within the predicted area.     4     Gazelles preferred an intermediate range of vegetation productivity, presumably facing quality quantity trade-offs where areas with low NDVI are limited by low ingestion rates, and areas with high NDVI are limited by the low digestibility of mature forage.     5     Spatiotemporal variation of gazelle habitat areas was high. Only 15{\%} of the study area was consistently gazelle habitat throughout all survey periods, indicating that gazelles need to range over vast areas in search of food. Only 1{\%} of the gazelle habitats were consistently located inside protected areas.     6     Synthesis and applications. Habitat variability in grasslands often leads to area requirements of ungulates that prevent effective conservation within single protected areas. They require landscape-level management plans, but dynamic habitat predictions to inform such plans are difficult to implement and are often unavailable. We showed that satellite estimates of vegetation productivity can be used successfully to generate dynamic habitat models in landscapes with highly variable resources, and demonstrated that intermediate NDVI values were critical to predict occurrence of Mongolian gazelles.},

	Abstract = {Latitude estimates from light recorded by electronic data storage tags typically contain large errors, particularly at times near the equinoxes. We employ error propagation analysis to the fundamental equation relating latitude to solar elevation and time of day. Large latitude errors are caused by mathematical amplification of small errors in relating solar irradiance to solar elevation. Furthermore, the sign of these errors is such that the estimated latitude is badly biased. This analysis leads directly to a method of removing systematic error (bias) from latitude estimates in state-space track reconstruction models. Preliminary implementation of this method effectively removes all bias from latitude estimated from solar irradiance recorded by archival tags deployed both on moorings and on freely swimming tuna},

	Abstract = {Diving ontogeny studies enable the examination of both the evolution of diving strategies and the physiological constraints and environmental factors determining foraging behaviour. Northern fur seal (NFS) Callorhinus ursinus pups that undertake far-ranging migrations in their first year are an ideal species for examining such factors. The diving behaviour of 64 NFS pups from 4 North American breeding sites was studied using satellite-dive recorders deployed on pups prior to weaning. Summarised diving activity (6 h histograms of dive depth and duration) was recorded during the pups' first 8 mo at sea and transmitted via satellite. During the first month at sea, pups adopted the nocturnal diving patterns characteristic of adults, with average maximum nightly and crepuscular dive depths and durations exceeding daytime values by a factor of from 4 to 4.5. Diving capacity in terms of maximum depths (112 m) and durations (285 s) attained also increased linearly with age until {\~{}}8 to 10 mo of age. Overlaid on diving capability development was the significant influence of environmental cues, such as lunar phase, on migratory diving behaviour. During full moons, pups dived deeper and for longer periods than during other lunar phases, as pups likely mimicked the behaviour of their vertically migrating prey. These findings indicate that prey accessibility, particularly for younger pups with reduced diving capacity, may prove more challenging during higher lunar illumination periods. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

	Abstract = {Geolocation data were recovered from archival tags applied to bigeye tuna near Hawaii. A state-space Kalman filter statistical model was used to estimate geolocation errors, movement parameters, and most probable tracks from the recovered data. Standard deviation estimates ranged from 0.5degrees to 4.4degrees latitude and from 0.2degrees to 1.6degrees longitude. Bias estimates ranged from -1.9degrees to 4.1degrees latitude and from -0.5degrees to 3.0degrees longitude. Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3 nm day(-1) for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000 nm(2) day(-1) . Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates. The state-space Kalman filter model appears to provide realistic estimates of in situ geolocation errors and movement parameters, provides a means to avoid indeterminate latitude estimates during equinoxes, and is a potential bridge between analyses of individual and population movements.},

	Abstract = {Aim To demonstrate how the interrelations of individual movements form large- scale population-level movement patterns and how these patterns are associated with the underlying landscape dynamics by comparing ungulate movements across species. Locations Arctic tundra in Alaska and Canada, temperate forests in Massachu- setts, Patagonian Steppes in Argentina, Eastern Steppes in Mongolia. Methods We used relocation data from four ungulate species (barren-ground caribou, Mongolian gazelle, guanaco and moose) to examine individual move- ments and the interrelation of movements among individuals. We applied and developed a suite of spatial metrics that measure variation in movement among individuals as population dispersion,movement coordination and realized mobil- ity. Taken together, these metrics allowed us to quantify and distinguish among different large-scale population-level movement patterns such as migration, range residency and nomadism.We then related the population-levelmovement patterns to the underlying landscape vegetation dynamics via long-term remote sensing measurements of the temporal variability, spatial variability and unpredictability of vegetation productivity. Results Moose, which remained in sedentary home ranges, and guanacos, which were partially migratory, exhibited relatively short annual movements associated with landscapes having very little broad-scale variability in vegetation.Caribou and gazelle performed extreme long-distance movements that were associated with broad-scale variability in vegetation productivity during the peak of the growing season. Caribou exhibited regular seasonal migration in which individuals were clustered for most of the year and exhibited coordinated movements. In contrast, gazelle were nomadic, as individuals were independently distributed andmoved in an uncoordinated manner that relates to the comparatively unpredictable (yet broad-scale) vegetation dynamics of their landscape. Main conclusions We show how broad-scale landscape unpredictability may lead to nomadism, an understudied type of long-distancemovement. In contrast to classical migration where landscapes may vary at broad scales but in a predictable manner, long-distance movements of nomadic individuals are uncoordinated and independent from other such individuals. Landscapes with little broad-scale vari- ability in vegetation productivity feature smaller-scale movements and allow for range residency. Nomadism requires distinct integrative conservation strategies that facilitate long-distance movements across the entire landscape and are not limited to certain migration corridors.},

	Abstract = {The move to ecosystem-based management of marine fisheries and endangered species would be greatly facilitated by a quantitative method for identifying marine ecosystems that captures temporal dynamics at meso-scale (10s or 100s of kilometers) resolutions. Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem boundaries, which may differ according to the species of interest or the management objectives, is a fundamental challenge of ecosystem-based management. We present an adaptive ecosystem classification that begins to address these challenges. To demonstrate the approach, we quantitatively bounded distinct, biologically meaningful marine regions in the North Pacific Ocean based on physical oceanography. We identified the regions by applying image classification algorithms to a comprehensive description of the ocean's surface, derived from an oceanographic circulation model. Our resulting maps illustrate 15 distinct marine regions. The size and location of these regions related well to previously described water masses in the North Pacific. We investigated seasonal and long-term changes in the pattern of regions and their boundaries by dividing the oceanographic data into four seasons and two 10-year time periods, one on either side of the 1976-1977 North Pacific Ocean climate regime shift. We compared our results for each season across the regime shift and for sequential seasons within regimes using the Kappa Index of Agreement and the index of Average Mutual Information. Seasonal patterns were more similar between regimes than from one season to the next within a regime, while the magnitude of seasonal transitions appeared to differ before and after the regime shift. We assessed the biological relevance of the identified regions using seasonal maps derived from remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations ([chl-a]). We used Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to evaluate the correspondence between the [chl-a] maps and our post-regime shift regions. There was a significant difference in [chl-a] among the regions in all seasons. We found that the number of regions with distinct chlorophyll signatures, and the associations between different regions, varied by season. The overall pattern of association between the regions was suggestive of observed, broad-scale patterns in the seasonal development and distribution of primary production in the North Pacific. This demonstrated that regions with different biological properties can be delineated using only physical variables. The flexibility of our approach will enable researchers to visualize the geographic extents of regions with similar physical conditions, providing insight into ocean dynamics and changes in marine ecosystems. It will also provide resource managers with a powerful tool for broad application in ecosystem-based management and conservation of marine resources. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {1. Double-tagging experiments are invaluable for determining the accuracy and precision of location data provided by different telemetry technologies used with free-ranging animals.$\backslash$n2. We developed a state-space modelling framework for estimating the precision of telemetry location data based on double-tagging experiments. The model is simultaneously fitted to multiple data types with different temporal resolutions while including errors in all data.$\backslash$n3. We used the model to estimate the precision of a specific geolocation method based on light and sea surface temperature applied to a large marine telemetry dataset. Data were available from double-tagging experiments on 111 animals representing seven marine species including 4 sharks, 2 birds and 1 pinniped. Study animals carried electronic tags that provided geolocation estimates as well as more precise satellite-based location data (Argos and Global Positioning System).$\backslash$n4. Estimates of the precision of geolocations were similar to previous findings. The overall estimated SD of geolocation errors for each species ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 3{\textperiodcentered}9$\,^{\circ}$ for longitude and 0{\textperiodcentered}8 to 3{\textperiodcentered}6$\,^{\circ}$ for latitude.$\backslash$n5. While these results are specific to this particular type of location estimation method, the state-space framework presented here is a robust approach to estimating the precision of various types of telemetry location data from double-tagging experiments. The model simultaneously allows for appropriate inferences about true animal locations and movement.},

	Abstract = {A weekly 1$\,^{\circ}$ spatial resolution optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis has been produced at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using both in situ and satellite data from November 1981 to the present. The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly −0.03$\,^{\circ}$C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1$\,^{\circ}$C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5$\,^{\circ}$C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05$\,^{\circ}$C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large. However, smaller unexplained differences also occur in other regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere where in situ data should be adequate.},

	Abstract = {Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L{\'{e}}vy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

	Abstract = {To address the lack of fisheries-independent information for Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), we released 21 adults (131 $\pm$ 12 cm curved fork length) between 2008 and 2010 in the Sargasso Sea and Northwest Atlantic. Data from nine tags (range: 1--292 days; mean: 89 days) revealed (i) pronounced north--south movements in pelagic waters between areas including Georges Bank, Mid- and South Atlantic Bight, Caribbean Sea, and Brazilian shelf, (ii) a lack of east--west exchange, and (iii) a high-use area in the Hatteras Plain, centered southwest of Bermuda. Bigeye tuna occupied water masses of 2.7--28.2 $\,^{\circ}$C and depths of 0--1280 m, with deeper depths in the daytime (daily mean $\pm$ standard deviation: 196 $\pm$ 92 m) than at nighttime (45 $\pm$ 29 m). Even though bigeye tuna are assumed to forage on the deep scattered layer during the day, generalized additive mixed models did not identify the deep scattered layer as an important predictor of daytime swimming depth. Model results highlight the importance of geographic location in influencing habitat utilization, and thus suggest the need for fisheries-independent monitoring in high-catch areas, such as the central and equatorial Atlantic.},

	Abstract = {In the three decades since its introduction, resource selection analysis (RSA) has become a widespread method for analyzing spatial patterns of animal relocations obtained from telemetry studies. Recently, mechanistic home range models have been proposed as an alternative framework for studying patterns of animal space-use. In contrast to RSA models, mechanistic home range models are derived from underlying mechanistic descriptions of individual movement behavior and yield spatially explicit predictions for patterns of animal space-use. In addition, their mechanistic underpinning means that, unlike RSA, mechanistic home range models can also be used to predict changes in space-use following perturbation. In this paper, we develop a formal reconciliation between these two methods of home range analysis, showing how differences in the habitat preferences of individuals give rise to spatially explicit patterns of space-use. The resulting unified framework combines the simplicity of resource selection analysis with the spatially explicit and predictive capabilities of mechanistic home range models.},

	Abstract = {Tractable conservation measures for long-lived species require the intersection between protection of biologically relevant life history stages and a socioeconomically feasible setting. To protect breeding adults, we require knowledge of animal movements, how movement relates to political boundaries, and our confidence in spatial analyses of movement. We used satellite tracking and a switching state-space model to determine the internesting movements of olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (n = 18) in Central Africa during two breeding seasons (2007-08, 2008-09). These movements were analyzed in relation to current park boundaries and a proposed transboundary park between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, both created to reduce unintentional bycatch of sea turtles in marine fisheries. We additionally determined confidence intervals surrounding home range calculations. Turtles remained largely within a 30 km radius from the original nesting site before departing for distant foraging grounds. Only 44.6 percent of high-density areas were found within the current park but the proposed transboundary park would incorporate 97.6 percent of high-density areas. Though tagged individuals originated in Gabon, turtles were found in Congolese waters during greater than half of the internesting period (53.7 percent), highlighting the need for international cooperation and offering scientific support for a proposed transboundary park. This is the first comprehensive study on the internesting movements of solitary nesting olive ridley sea turtles, and it suggests the opportunity for tractable conservation measures for female nesting olive ridleys at this and other solitary nesting sites around the world. We draw from our results a framework for cost-effective protection of long-lived species using satellite telemetry as a primary tool.},

The continuous-time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous-time model was placed into a state-space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.},

	Abstract = {Recent progress in positioning technology facilitates the collection of massive amounts of sequential spatial data on animals. This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs. Keywords},

@article{Lam2015a,
	Abstract = {Abstract Striped marlin (Kajikia audax) are highly valuable in commercial and recreational fisheries, and recently determined to be overfished in the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean, but direct field observations of their vertical habitats are lacking. To characterize their spatial and oceanographic associations across multiple regions in the Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Southern California, Baja California, Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador), we analyzed behavioral data returned by 159 pop-up satellite archival tags (median, maximum deployment: 61; 259 days). Striped marlin demonstrated pronounced use of the mixed layer, with fish spending at least 54{\%} of their time between 0 and 10 m across all regions. Individuals remained near the surface in nighttime and were located near the bottom of the mixed layer during daytime. Although striped marlin shared a thermal niche {\textgreater}20 $\,^{\circ}$C and remained within ∼8 $\,^{\circ}$C of sea surface temperature (SST), even when 15--31 $\,^{\circ}$C SSTs were experienced, the deepest depth (532 m) and coldest temperature (8.6 $\,^{\circ}$C) recorded to date indicated broader habitat associations. Vertical activity below the mixed layer comprised a lesser portion (5--45{\%}) of their time at depth but suggests that key ecological functions occur there. We examined the effects of spatiotemporal and environmental factors on percent time spent at ≥60 m and maximum depth through the use of generalized additive mixed models. Location, SST, mixed layer depth, temperature at 100 m and dissolved oxygen at 100 m and 300 m were significant predictors of vertical activity. Striped marlin exploited cold ({\textless}15 $\,^{\circ}$C) or low oxygen ({\textless}3.5 ml L−1) environments for short durations (10--40 min), presumably for foraging and predator avoidance. Understanding vertical habitat characteristics of striped marlin is necessary for evaluating their vulnerability to gear, for identification of realistic bycatch reduction measures, and for providing spatially explicit information in stock assessments.},

	Abstract = {This paper establishes simple and general expressions for the accuracy of geolocation, which may be obtained by optimal filtering of measurements from archival tags. We investigate an idealized geolocation problem where the animal performs a random walk. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the steady-state variance and for the characteristic time scale of the filter, i.e. the smoothing horizon. This leads to temporal and spatial scales defining the limit of resolution and explains the difference between what can be obtained for fast-moving and slow-moving animals. Using frequency-domain methods, we consider the effect of adding additional sensors, and examine the substitution of the random walk model with anomalous diffusion, e.g. a L{\'{e}}vy flight. We also discuss time variations in the accuracy near start and end of the time series, and due to holes in the data stream which e.g. arise in the tidal method for geolocation when the animal is pelagic. Our results are particularly useful to the planning of a tagging study, because our estimates of accuracy can be computed using only three parameters: the swimming speed of the animal, the sample interval, and the variance on the measurement error.},

	Abstract = {The study of animal movement and behavior is being revolutionized by technology, such as satellite tags and harmonic radar, that allows us to track the movements of individual animals. However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broad- er-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation tech- niques, all under a single statistical framework.

	Abstract = {1.  Linking the movement and behaviour of animals to their environment is a central problem in ecology. Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development.  2.  In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner.  3.  It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters.  4.  To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {Behaviour and distribution of striped marlin within the southwest Pacific Ocean were investigated using electronic tagging data collected from 2005-2008. A continuous-time correlated random-walk Kalman filter was used to integrate double-tagging data exhibiting variable error structures into movement trajectories composed of regular time-steps. This state-space trajectory integration approach improved longitude and latitude error distributions by 38.5 km and 22.2 km respectively. Using these trajectories as inputs, a behavioural classification model was developed to infer when, and where, 'transiting' and 'area-restricted' (ARB) pseudo-behavioural states occurred. ARB tended to occur at shallower depths (108 +/- 49 m) than did transiting behaviours (127 +/- 57 m). A 16 day post-release period of diminished ARB activity suggests that patterns of behaviour were affected by the capture and/or tagging events, implying that tagged animals may exhibit atypical behaviour upon release. The striped marlin in this study dove deeper and spent greater time at {\textgreater}/= 200 m depth than those in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. As marlin reached tropical latitudes (20-21 degrees S) they consistently reversed directions, increased swimming speed and shifted to transiting behaviour. Reversals in the tropics also coincided with increases in swimming depth, including increased time {\textgreater}/= 250 m. Our research provides enhanced understanding of the behavioural ecology of striped marlin. This has implications for the effectiveness of spatially explicit population models and we demonstrate the need to consider geographic variation when standardizing CPUE by depth, and provide data to inform natural and recreational fishing mortality parameters.},

	Abstract = {The study of how and why marine animals distribute themselves at sea has important conservation and management implications of the species and their habitats. We characterize the oceanographic and biological landscapes of the marine areas used by breeding Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes giganteus) at Patagonian colonies and explore inter-sexual and inter-colony differences. The at-sea movements of 16 adults (7 males and 9 females) were studied by means of satellite telemetry techniques during 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2004 breeding seasons. Southern Giant Petrels utilized an oceanographic scenario characterized by high productivity, warm sea surface temperature, and shallow waters. The biological landscape was characterized by a high availability of squid and carrion nearby colonies. Females spent more time in the shelf break and exploited deeper waters than males. In contrast, males spent more time in coastal areas and they showed a higher spatial overlap with areas of high squid density than females. Such a prosperous foraging scenario for both sexes may play a key role in the growth of the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrel Patagonian colonies.},

	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of neutral genetic diversity is mainly influenced by barriers to dispersal. The nature of such barriers varies according to the dispersal means and capabilities of the organisms concerned. Although these barriers are often obvious on land, in the ocean they can be more difficult to identify. Determining the relative influence of physical and biotic factors on genetic connectivity remains a major challenge for marine ecologists. Here, we compare gene flow patterns of 7 littoral fish species from 6 families with a range of early-life-history traits sampled at the same geographic locations across common environmental discontinuities in the form of oceanic fronts in the Western Mediterranean. We show that these fronts represent major barriers to gene flow and have a strong influence on the population genetic structure of some fish species. We also found no significant relation between the early-life-history traits most commonly investigated (egg type, pelagic larval duration, and inshore-offshore spawning) and gene flow patterns, suggesting that other life-history factors should deserve attention. The fronts analyzed and the underlying physical mechanisms are not site-specific but common among the oceans, suggesting the generality of our findings. },

	Abstract = {The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) is of high ecological and economic importance to the western Caribbean region, and contains spawning sites for a number of reef fish species. Despite this, little is known of the distribution and transport of pelagic fish larvae in the area, and basic in situ information on larval fish assemblages is lacking. Here we describe the results of two biological oceanography research cruises conducted in winter-spring of 2006 and 2007, focusing on larval fish assemblages. We use multivariate assemblage analyses to examine vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics of larval fish assemblages, to highlight key distinguishing taxa, and to relate these to the observed oceanographic structure. Our results showed a general separation between the Gulf of Honduras region, which was characterized by weaker currents and high abundances of inshore and estuarine taxa (Eleotridae, Priacanthidae), and the northern MBRS, which was subject to strong northward flow and contained a mixture of mesopelagic and reef-associated taxa (Myctophidae, Sparidae). Although distinct patterns of vertical distribution were observed among taxa, both shallow and deep living larvae were broadly distributed throughout the study area. Analysis of historical drifter tracks highlighted the strong northward flow and low retention conditions typically present along the northern MBRS, as well as potential connectivity between the western Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The movement patterns of broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the South Pacific Ocean are largely unknown. Understanding the connectivity of the species across the Pacific and any variability in diving behaviour as it relates to fisheries availability/catchability are of particular relevance. Here, we present an electronic tagging dataset spanning the western and eastern South Pacific Ocean regions. Movements observed suggest a lack of connectivity between the southern and northern regions of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and limited connectivity between the eastern and western parts of the Tasman and Coral Seas in the south-western Pacific Ocean. At least some swordfish appear to undertake movements between tropical waters extending from around Vanuatu to French Polynesia to waters around New Zealand, indicating greater connectivity than previously thought. Observations indicate no movement between the WCPO and the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), although data from boundary areas are lacking. Swordfish demonstrated a mixture of diel vertical distributions and daytime surface behaviour, spending time mostly in waters {\textless}. 100. m during the night and {\textgreater}. 400. m during the day. Diel vertical movements resulted in movement through water temperatures that varied on the order of 15-20$\,^{\circ}$. C with temperatures at depth as low as 2.4$\,^{\circ}$. C and those at the surface as high as 31.4$\,^{\circ}$. C. Vertical distributions of swordfish varied both spatially and temporally with swordfish in the Tasman/Coral Seas demonstrating the least variability. Spatio-temporal variability in vertical distributions is likely driven by variability in environmental conditions and associated prey distributions. Swordfish tagged in the Tasman/Coral Seas and in the EPO interrupted deeper daytime distributions with two distinct types of surfacing behaviour: temporally associated and temporally isolated. Temporally isolated surface behaviour occurred throughout the year and in association with on average lower sea surface temperatures. Temporally associated surface behaviour was restricted to austral summer months only and in association with on average higher sea surface temperatures. Our results represent a major step towards reducing uncertainty about the spatial dynamics of swordfish in the South Pacific Ocean. At the same time, questions as to the extent of connectivity of swordfish throughout the south Pacific and the linkages between spawning ground and foraging ground locations are raised. Further investigation of the movements of swordfish from the central southern Pacific Ocean is required to determine what linkages there may be between the WCPO and the EPO and whether connectivity suggested by genetic studies is supported. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMO) are often criticized for ineffectual management of high-seas fisheries resources. However, in the case of the two Atlantic swordfish stocks occurring in the North and South Atlantic, those stocks have rebuilt to the BMSY objective of the responsible RFMO, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The relative contribution of the management actions of the RFMO and biological characteristics of swordfish stocks are evaluated in relation to the recovery of the stocks. It is concluded that while swordfish have characteristics that promote stock resilience (including relatively fast growth, and spatially- and temporally-dispersed spawning), positive management actions combined with a period of relatively good recruitmentwere essential to achieve the rebuilt outcome. The challenges that the RFMO faces to maintain the stocks in the rebuilt condition are described, and some possible additional measures discussed.},

	Abstract = {During January-May, surface manifestation of multiple, individual basin-scale fronts accentuate the central North Pacific Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ) system. The most prominent of these fronts are climatologically located at 32degrees-34degreesN and at 28degrees-30degreesN latitudes [herein nominally referred to as the 'Subtropical Front' (STF) and the 'South Subtropical Front' (SSTF), respectively], although considerable interannual variability in both position and intensity is observed. This seasonally dynamic system is also the region typically targeted by the Hawaii-based swordfish (Xiphias gladius ) longline fishing fleet, where the presence, position, and strength of the convergent fronts are believed to play a key role with regard to the catch and catch rates of swordfish. Information furnished by a recent series of meridional hydrographic surveys and concurrent satellite remote sensing data elucidate structural patterns and coupling of the physics and biology associated with these fronts. This enables a re-characterization of the spring North Pacific STFZ and offers new insight into the seasonal variability of the phytoplankton dynamics in the subtropical North Pacific. On synoptic time scales, geographical positioning of the fronts may be systematically identified through surface outcropping of diagnostic thermohaline isopleths and therefore readily discerned from both shipboard surveys and by spaceborne sensors. The STF during spring can be characterized by the surface expression of the 34.8 isohaline and the 17degreesC isotherm within the frontal gradient. Biologically, the STF marks the transition from low chloropigment (chlorophyll + phaeopigments), nutrient-depleted surface waters to the south to a more productive regime to the north. To the south, the 20degreesC and 35.0 surface isotherm and isohaline, respectively, are characteristically embedded in the thermohaline gradients associated with the SSTF. A sharp increase in depth-integrated chloropigment is also observed at the SSTF and is ascribed to an increase in the concentration and thickness of the subsurface chloropigment maximum (SCM) prompted by the shoaling of the nutricline with the thermocline structure into the euphotic zone.},

	Abstract = {Although bluefin tuna are found throughout the Atlantic Ocean, spawning in the western Atlantic has been recorded predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in spring. Larval bluefin tuna abundances from the northern GOM are formulated into an index used to tune the adult stock assessment, and the var- iability of this index is currently high. This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval bluefin tuna abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval bluefin tuna catch locations, and a suite of environ- mental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, would be more likely to contain bluefin tuna larvae. Favorable habitat for bluefin tuna larvae was defined using a classification tree approach. Habitat within the Loop Current was generally less favorable, as were warm- core rings, and cooler waters on the continental shelf. The location and size of favorable habitat was highly variable among years, which was reflected in the locations of larval bluefin tuna catches. The model successfully placed bluefin tuna larvae in favorable habitat with nearly 90{\%} accuracy, but many negative stations were also located within theoretically favor- able habitat. The probability of collecting larval bluefin tuna in favorable habitat was nearly twice the probability of collecting bluefin tuna larvae across all habitats (35.5 versus 21.0{\%}). This model is a useful addition to knowledge of larval bluefin tuna distributions; however, the incorporation of variables describing finer-scale features, such as thermal fronts, may significantly improve the model's predictive power.},

Stomachs were collected from 86 swordfish. The diet was analysed in terms of prey occurrence, relative abundance, reconstituted mass, and size distribution. It consisted mainly of fish, 40.5{\%} by mass ({\%}M) and cephalopods, 59.3{\%}M; crustaceans, 0.2{\%}M, were considered secondary prey. When considering only the fresh fraction to allow for differential digestion rates, these figures were 77.3{\%}M, 22.7{\%}M, and trace amounts, respectively. Lanternfish, including Notoscopelus kroeyeri and Symbolophorus veranyi, were abundant, but paralepidids, Atlantic pomfret (Brama brama), and the squid Todarodes sagittatus, Ommastrephes bartramii, and Gonatus steenstrupi, dominated the diet by mass. The overall prey size range was 11-1420 mm, but sizes of 60-360 mm accounted for 80{\%} of the distribution by number and of 140-760 mm for 80{\%} of the distribution by mass. Intraspecifically, larger swordfish ate larger prey as a result of a change in species composition of the diet. The swordfish appears to show feeding plasticity both between different areas and between animals in the same area. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

	Abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is the primary spawning ground for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). In this work, information reported by previous studies about the preferred environmental conditions for the occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae in the GOM is integrated into a dimensionless index, the BFT{\_}Index. This index is used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae within the GOM during 1993--2011. The main findings of this work are that: (i) the proposed index successfully captures the spatial and temporal variability in the in situ occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae; (ii) areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae in the GOM exhibit year-to-year spatial and temporal variability linked with mesoscale ocean features and sea surface temperature; and (iii) comparison of the BFT{\_}Index derived variability with recruitment of age-0 fish estimated from recent stock assessment indicates that changes in environmental conditions may drive a relevant component ({\~{}}58{\%}) of the recruitment variability. The comparison with the recruitment dataset further revealed the existence of key regions linked with recruitment in the central/northern GOM, and that the Loop Current may function as a trap for larvae, possibly leading to low survival rates. Above (below) average conditions for occurrence of larvae in the GOM during spring were observed in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006--2008, and 2011 (1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2010).

The observed changes in the direction of the CPUEs correspond with changes in trends in the summer Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a long term mode of variability of North Atlantic sea surface temperature. To test the hypothesis of a relation between the CPUE and the AMO, the CPUEs were made spatially explicit by re-estimating using an "areas-as-fleets" approach. These new CPUEs were then used to create alternative stock histories. The residuals of the fit were then regressed against the summer AMO. Significant, and opposite, relations were found in the regressions between eastern and western Atlantic areas. When the AMO was in a warm phase, the CPUEs in the western (eastern) areas were higher (lower) than predicted by the assessment model fit. Given the observed temperature tolerance limits of swordfish, it is possible that either their preferred habitat, prey species, or both have shifted spatial distributions resulting in conflicting CPUE indices. Because the available CPUE time series only overlaps with one change in the sign of the AMO ({\~{}}1995), it is not clear whether this is a directional or cyclical trend. Given the relatively localized nature of many of the fishing fleets, and the difficulty of separating fleet effects from changes in oceanography we feel that it is critical to create CPUE indices by combining data across similar fleets that fish in similar areas. This approach allowed us to evaluate area-specific catch rates which provided the power to detect basin-wide responses to changing oceanography, a critical step for providing robust management advice in a changing climate.},

	Abstract = {The efficiency of a pelagic longline fishing operation and the species composition of the resulting catch is influenced primarily by the relationship between the distribution of hooks and species vulnerability, with vulnerability described by either depth or some suite of environmental variables. We therefore fitted longline catch rate models to determine whether catch is estimated better by vertically distributing a species by depth or by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, thermocline gradient, and oxygen concentration). Catch rates were estimated by two methods: (i) monitoring longlines where the vertical distribution of hooks and catch in relation to depth and environmental conditions is known, and (ii) applying a statistical habitat-based standardization (statHBS) model to fishery and environmental data to develop relative abundance indices for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Results indicated that an understanding of gear dynamics and environmental influences are important for analyzing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data correctly. Analyses based on depth-specific catch rates can lead to serious misinterpretation of abundance trends, despite the use of sophisticated statistical techniques (e.g., generalized linear mixed models). This illustrates that inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of important covariates can bias estimates of relative abundance, which may be a common occurrence in CPUE analysis.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides information on the spawning area of three species managed by ICCAT -- albacore tuna, swordfish, white marlin -- in the southern Sargasso Sea. The significance of the Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ), an important oceanographic feature in the southern Sargasso Sea, is highlighted. Albacore tuna are shown to spawn in March and April between 20$\,^{\circ}$- 23{\textordmasculine} N. and 60$\,^{\circ}$-70{\textordmasculine} W. in proximity to the STCZ. Female swordfish in spawning condition were sampled from a larger latitudinal range (18$\,^{\circ}$- 25{\textordmasculine} N.) and further east (55$\,^{\circ}$- 65{\textordmasculine} W.). Swordfish spawning occurs from December to June within the subtropical area (13$\,^{\circ}$--35$\,^{\circ}$ N.), but it appears that the southern Sargasso Sea is one of the areas of more intense reproduction. White marlin spawn in essentially the same area as albacore from April to June. The overlap of the spawning areas between the three species during similar time periods and in proximity to the STCZ suggests that some management/conservation measures should be considered to protect the spawning stocks in this area. An analysis of the ICCAT catch records for these three species for the southern Sargasso Sea (20$\,^{\circ}$-30{\textordmasculine} N.) indicates that the catches from this zone are not generally a significant contributor to the catches from the Sargasso Sea as a whole.},

	Abstract = {Hydrographic data from two oceanographic cruises conducted during March 2006 and January/February 2007 are used to investigate the thermohaline structure related to the observed circulation along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). From our observations we identify three water masses in the MBRS: the Caribbean Surface Water (CSW), North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater (SUW), and Tropical Atlantic Central Water (TACW). Little vertical structure in temperature is observed in the upper 100 m of the water column, but important differences are observed in the salinity distribution both horizontally and with depth. Freshwater inputs to the system from the mainland can be traced in the surface layer, with two possible sources: one from surface rivers located along the southern portion of the MBRS, and the other originating from an underground river system located along the northern portion of the MBRS. The thermohaline structure in the MBRS reflects the dynamics of the observed circulation. Uplifted isopycnals along most of the central and northern coastline of the MBRS reflect the effects of the strong geostrophic circulation flowing northward, i.e. the Yucatan Current. To the south along the MBRS, much weaker velocities are observed, with the Honduras Gyre dominating the flow in this region as presented during January/February 2007. These two regions are separated by onshore and divergent alongshore flow associated with the impingement of the Cayman Current on the shore and the MBRS.},

	Abstract = {The capacity of the Azores Archipelago to capture and retain incoming particles and organisms that are drifting with the oceanic currents was the main focus of this study. Using the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model coupled with the Connectivity Modeling System (an offline Lagrangian tool) a series of experiments were conducted to determine: i) the origin of the particles that reach the archipelago, ii) the capacity of each island sub-group to retain incoming particles and organisms, as well as the iii) oceanographic phenomena that lead to their transport and retention. The Gulf Stream (GS) and the westward propagating eddy corridors were identified as the main transport pathways affecting the Azores region. Eddy Kinetic Energy from altimetry data and Lyapunov exponent analysis suggest that eddies and filaments are the main delivery mechanisms. In the upper mixed layer, the GS and its associated eddies are a predominant regional oceanographic feature injecting particles from the north and west boundaries toward the Azores. The capacity to capture particles of each island sub-group was directly proportional to their size, while the retention time within the Azores region increased with depth, associated with the decrease in velocity of the intermediate water currents. This study opens new prospects to understand transport in the Mid-Atlantic (Azores) region and the islands' role in marine colonization, dispersal, fisheries recruitment and speciation.},

	Abstract = {The direct ocean current observations across the Yucatan Channel collected during the Canek program allow the best description to date of the exchange between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. A net transport of 23.8 $\pm$ 1 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s1; 95{\%} confidence interval) flowed through the Yucatan Channel from the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico, during the period between September 1999 and June 2000. This is about 20 percent less than the 30 Sv accepted as the nominal transport of the Florida Current, and less also than the 28 Sv assumed for Yucatan in closing the transport budgets for Caribbean passages. The discrepancy may be an imbalance due to fluctuations in the transports through other passages of the system, especially the Old Bahama and Northwest Providence Channels, which remain poorly known. Our data corroborate the principal features of the flow through the Yucatan Channel: The northerly surface Yucatan Current and its southerly Under-current off Mexico, and the southerly surface Cuban Counter-current near Cuba; but previously unobserved mean currents are found to exist at depth, especially on the eastern side of the channel. Fluctuations seen in the deep flows are related to volume anomalies over the Gulf of Mexico. A transport through the Yucatan Channel smaller than previously thought has significant implications for the dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico and its modeling, since this transport is the principal forcing of its circulation. The circulation budgets in the Western Subtropical Atlantic should be revised considering these new results. INDEX},

	Abstract = {Guidelines for the assessment and management of developing swordfish fisheries are derived through an examination of five swordfish fisheries. As they develop, swordfish fisheries may be inclined to local depletion around underwater features, such as seamounts and banks. Few nations have applied the precautionary approach in managing their developing swordfish fisheries. Without controls, swordfish fisheries expand geographically and fishing effort increases, often overshooting optimum levels. However, it is difficult to distinguish clear evidence of fishery collapse; modern longliners harvest widely distributed tuna and swordfish and they are able to relocate to distant areas or switch between target species in response to fluctuations in species abundance and price. Furthermore, the wide distribution of swordfish combined with year-round spawning and high growth rates amongst juveniles probably contribute to the apparent resilience of swordfish stocks to intensive harvesting. Over half the world's swordfish catch is taken as an incidental catch of longliners fishing for tuna. In several areas, such as the North Atlantic, catch quotas have sometimes caused tuna longline fishers to discard swordfish. Minimum size limits have also resulted in discarding of swordfish in tuna fisheries and in dedicated swordfish fisheries. In addition to weakening the effectiveness of those management measures, bycatch and discarding add to the complexities of managing swordfish fisheries and to uncertainties in assessing the stocks. Longliners that target swordfish often fish at high latitudes where interactions with marine wildlife, such as seabird, are generally more frequent than at low latitudes. Concern over incidental catches of marine wildlife and other species is becoming a driving force in the management of several swordfish fisheries. Fishery management organisations will need to implement management measures to protect non-target species and gather reliable data and information on the situation by placing observers on boats fishing for swordfish.},

@article{Richardson2009a,
	Abstract = {Fronts and eddies are widely hypothesized to be critical spawning habitat for large pelagic fishes, due to increased larval and/or adult feeding opportunities at these features. We examined sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) spawning around a cyclonic, submesoscale (∼13 × 7 km) Florida Current frontal eddy. The temporal progression of eddy dynamics over a 65 h period was determined using ocean color satellite imagery, continuous surface measurements along the cruise track, and non-linear least-squares fitting of the positions of three drifters deployed within the eddy. A peak in larval sailfish densities (n = 2435, stations = 49), composed primarily of yolk-sac and first-feeding larvae, occurred at the eddy frontal zone. A majority of these larvae were estimated to have been spawned during the formation of the eddy. A comparison between the distribution of similar-age sailfish and scombrid larvae indicated that the peak in larval sailfish density likely resulted from spawning directly at the front, rather than transport by convergent flow. The first-feeding prey items of larval sailfish (Farranula and Corycaeus copepods) were most abundant at the frontal zone and to a lesser extent inside the eddy. Egg distributions were used to indirectly assess the distribution of adult sailfish prey items. Euthynnus alleteratus and Auxis spp. eggs were in highest abundance outside the eddy, while the eggs of small carangids were in highest abundance at the eddy frontal zone. Overall, this study indicates that sailfish spawn at small-scale oceanographic features that provide a favorable feeding environment for their larvae and potentially also for the adults. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The surface and sub-surface biological oceanography of tuna fishing grounds within the East Australian Current (EAC) was compared in 2004 with two other fishing areas further offshore. Our aim was to determine whether the biological oceanography of the region could explain the distribution and intensity of pelagic fishery catches inside and outside the EAC at that time. The EAC fishing area was noticeably warmer, less saline and lower in nutrients than waters in the other fishing areas. The EAC waters were dominated by large diatoms, the biomass of which was significantly higher than in the seamount and offshore areas, apparently the result of a cold core eddy beneath the EAC surface filament. Over the seamount and offshore more typical Tasman Sea waters prevailed, although the presence of a relatively deeper oxygen minimum layer over the seamount suggested topographically induced mixing in the area. Notably, sub-surface zooplankton and micronekton biomass was significantly higher around the seamount than in the two other areas. The offshore region was characterised by frontal activity associated with the Tasman front. Micronekton net biomass was generally highest in surface waters in this region. Examination of tuna catch records at that time showed yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) dominated the catches of the EAC, whereas swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) were the main species caught offshore. We suggest the yellowfin tuna concentrate in waters that are not only warmer but where prey species are concentrated near the surface. Offshore, deeper living species such as swordfish and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) can take advantage of prey species that are distributed deeper in the water column and along the flanks of the many seamounts in the region, or that are concentrated at fronts associated with the Tasman Front. Although only a snapshot of the region, relatively consistent catch data over time suggests the underlying biological oceanography may persist over longer time periods, particularly during the Austral spring. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

	Abstract = {Bycatch mitigation approaches aim to either reduce the incidence of unwanted catch or reduce bycatch mortalities. In pelagic longline fisheries incidence of unwanted catch can be reduced by limiting the availability of baited hooks (e.g., within bycatch species' preferred depths and water temperatures), whereas bycatch mortalities can be decreased by gear modifications and changes to fishing practices, e.g., by limiting soak time. To evaluate the effects of temperature, depth, and soak time on catch of target and bycatch species, temperature recorders were set along the length of the longline to characterize the environment at which hooks were fishing. Although few instrumented sets were fished, observations at the within set scale - specifically, that swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch did not increase with longer soak times - led us to reexamine assumptions made in fleet-wide catch models. Swordfish catch did not increase with soak time in generalized linear models based on fisheries observer data collected from swordfish-targeted sets fished by the Canadian pelagic longline fleet in 2008 and 2009 (n = 42 and n = 78, respectively). Minimum soak time, from end of setting to start of hauling, was used in swordfish catch models. Total soak time is inappropriate for catch models because it includes haulback time, which increases as a function of catch. If landed catch does not increase as a function of soak time, then limiting longline soak time to reduce bycatch mortalities would not cause decreased swordfish catch nor result in economic losses for fishers. While minimum soak time limits would likely decrease bycatch mortality rates in swordfish longline fisheries, impacts on other aspects of the fishing process would need to be considered, such as negative impacts on fisher safety. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

To date, these data have not been analyzed in terms of assemblage structure or variability, despite representing a highly valuable resource for examining decadal-scale change. In this study, multivariate statistical techniques were used to characterize temporal and spatial changes in abundances of the larvae of 20 common fish families from the early 1980s through to the late 2000s. The larvae of some pelagic and mesopelagic families showed marked increases in abundance over the survey time period, while the abundances of some benthic families decreased. Changes in assemblage structure were partially explained by changes in the Gulf of Mexico environment with respect to sea surface temperature and changes in shrimp trawling effort. Outflow from the Mississippi River was also influential on the interannual assemblage variability. However, the strong directional trends apparent in many family groups remained unexplained, and further research is required to discern the drivers of these patterns.},

	Abstract = {In species with high migratory potential, the genetic signal revealing population differentiation is often obscured by population admixture. To our knowledge, the explicit comparison of genetic samples from known spawning and feeding areas has not been conducted for any highly migratory pelagic fish species. This study examines the geographic heterogeneity of swordfish mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages within the Atlantic Ocean using 330 base pairs of sequence of the control region from 480 individuals. Hierarchical analyses of sequence variation were conducted to test whether samples from areas identified as the corresponding spawning and feeding grounds for the northwest (NW) Atlantic (Caribbean and Georges Banks-US northeast) and the South Atlantic (Brazil-Uruguay and Gulf of Guinea), were more closely related to each other than to samples from any other region, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. Phylogeographic analyses reveal that swordfish mtDNA phylogeny is characterized by incomplete lineage sorting and secondary contact of two highly divergent clades. However, despite this complex phylogenetic signature, results from an analysis of nucleotide diversity and from an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were for the most part concordant and indicate that NW Atlantic and South Atlantic swordfish belong to separate populations. The mtDNA distinctiveness of NW Atlantic and South Atlantic swordfish populations is indicative of philopatric behavior in swordfish towards breeding and feeding areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Catch-and-effort data from a longline vessel operating off the west coast of Portugal, and thermal imagery from NOAA satellites were employed to investigate the aggregation and availability of swordfish, bigeye and albacore tuna in relation to transient coastal upwelling features. We found a decreasing trend in swordfish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and an increasing trend in tuna species CPUE during the study period in apparent association with the progressively increasing intensity of the coastal upwelling regime from year to year. Swordfish CPUE were significantly higher on the warm side of surface thermal fronts associated with events of intensification/relaxation of coastal upwelling. The fishing efficiency for tuna species was significantly higher during peak upwelling conditions, in the close vicinity of mushroom-like structures at the edge of upwelling filaments. The present results do not support the existence of a preferred sea surface temperature (SST) range for these fish species. It is suggested that several mechanisms leading to the local concentration of prey provide adequate explanations for the aggregation of these species in the vicinity of frontal structures associated with coastal upwelling processes. },

Herein, what we believe is the first successful archival tag experiment with swordfish in the world is reported. The swordfish, which was harpooned with an archival tag encased in a plastic capsule, was released in July 1999 off the east coast of Japan. The fish was recaptured by a harpoon fishing vessel in June 2000, only 103 km from the tagging location and weighed approximately 120-kg. By comparing the water temperature data of the archival tag with oceanographic data, a cyclic seasonal migration between the food-rich Oyashio cold current area (40-45degreesN) during summer and the subtropical wintering area (10-20degreesN) was suggested. During most of the days of observation and for the majority of the time within a day, tagged fish swam in cold water (3-6degreesC) and deeper than approximately 200 m; at night, fish generally stayed near the warmer surface waters (21-27degreesC). The greatest swimming depth was approximated to be 900 m, deduced from ambient water temperature data. The swimming depth and behaviour pattern changed in response to the ambient water temperature.},

	Abstract = {Large and powerful ocean predators such as swordfishes, some tunas, and several shark species are unique among fishes in that they are capable of maintaining elevated body temperatures (endothermy) when hunting for prey in deep and cold water [1--3]. In these animals, warming the central nervous system and the eyes is the one common feature of this energetically costly adaptation [4]. In the swordfish (Xiphias gladius), a highly specialized heating system located in an extraocular muscle specifically warms the eyes and brain up to 10$\,^{\circ}$C--15$\,^{\circ}$C above ambient water temperatures [2, 5]. Although the function of neural warming in fishes has been the subject of considerable speculation [1, 6, 7], the biological significance of this unusual ability has until now remained unknown. We show here that warming the retina significantly improves temporal resolution, and hence the detection of rapid motion, in fast-swimming predatory fishes such as the swordfish. Depending on diving depth, temporal resolution can be more than ten times greater in these fishes than in fishes with eyes at the same temperature as the surrounding water. The enhanced temporal resolution allowed by heated eyes provides warm-blooded and highly visual oceanic predators, such as swordfishes, tunas, and sharks, with a crucial advantage over their agile, cold-blooded prey.},

The longest periods at large were 3847 and 3843 days for species Isurus oxyrhinchus (IOO) and Prionace glauca (PGO), respectively. The results would suggest that there are migratory patterns partially dependent on the tagging strategies used by the different countries and on the spatial and temporal pattern of the fishing effort carried out by the fleet reporting the recaptures. The overall recaptures show that the two species move over a wide range, but no transoceanic movements were detected. This would suggest that movements are limited to within each hemisphere. PGO data from the North Atlantic indicate that these sharks migrate between temperate and warm-water zones, with an apparent border curbing these migratory movements around regions of the Equator. Aspects related to the standardisation of the tagging-recapture protocols used by the different countries are also discussed. R{\'{E}}SUM{\'{E}}},

	Abstract = {A total of 21 swordfish, Xiphias gladius, were tagged with pop-up satellite tags in northern and southeastern areas of the North Atlantic Ocean. There were seasonal patterns in the horizontal movements, with fish tagged in the central North Atlantic moving southwards from the end of the year, generally south of 25??N, and returning to the temperate foraging grounds, north of 40??N, in spring. Although movements mainly took place latitudinally, fish tracks showed connectivity between the north central, north western, south eastern and north eastern North Atlantic. Average estimated daily displacements were 24.7??19.5kmday-1, and could average up to {\~{}}100kmday-1 in some months. The longest track recorded totaled more than 10,000km. Swordfish showed remarkable physiological versatility, inhabiting waters with SSTs ranging from 10.1 to 28.6??C, and subject to environmental temperatures of c. 4??C-28?? C, with daily ranges frequently over 15??C (mean 9.2??5.7). Fish showed a clear diel pattern in vertical behavior, feeding at 300-600m deep during daytime and staying in the mixed layer at night. There was a significant relationship between nocturnal depth and moonphase, quarter and sea surface temperature. The results of the present study are in agreement with the current separation between North Atlantic, Mediterranean and South Atlantic stocks, but suggest that the assumption of a single homogeneous stock in the North Atlantic might be overly simplistic. Further tagging studies, with special emphasis in areas and seasons not covered so far and in combination with other techniques, are still needed to elucidate the uncertainties of Atlantic swordfish stock structure.},

	Abstract = {Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction (GRASP) was used to map the spatial distribution of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the South Atlantic. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to relate catch to environmental predictor variables. Catch information from 38,000 Brazilian pelagic longline sets from 1980 to 2000 and size frequency data from 5000 longline sets from 1982 to 2000 were obtained from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT). Results highlight the importance of environmental variables for the fishery and for the spatial distribution of different size classes of swordfish (small, intermediate and large). The distribution of swordfish was closely associated with convergence zones (inter-tropical and sub-tropical), especially in the months of greatest convergence intensity. Spatial distribution patterns differed for the three studied size classes. The smallest size classes were found mainly in coastal zones and in areas with a shallow mixed layer ({\textless}20 m). In contrast intermediate-sized swordfish were mostly associated with the inter-tropical convergence and mixed layers of more than 20 m depth and large swordfish were often found in the vicinity of the sub-tropical convergence zone and in areas with mixed layers of less than 25 m and greater than 60 m. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Smith2015,
	Abstract = {Previous genetic studies of Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius L.) revealed significant differ- entiation among Mediterranean, North Atlantic and South Atlantic populations using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. However, limitations in geographic sampling cover- age, and the use of single loci, precluded an accurate placement of boundaries and of esti- mates of admixture. In this study, we presentmultilocus analyses of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 10 nuclear genes to estimate population differentiation and admixture based on the characterization of 774 individuals representing North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Mediterranean swordfish populations. Pairwise FST values,AMOVA, PCoA, and Bayesian individual assignments support the differentiation of swordfish inhabit- ing these three basins, but not the current placement of the boundaries that separate them. Specifically, the range of the South Atlantic population extends beyond 5$\,^{\circ}$N management boundary to 20$\,^{\circ}$N-25$\,^{\circ}$N from 45$\,^{\circ}$W. Likewise theMediterranean population extends beyond the current management boundary at the Strait of Gibraltar to approximately 10$\,^{\circ}$W. Further, admixture zones, characterized by asymmetric contributions of adjacent populations within samples, are confined to the Northeast Atlantic. While South Atlantic and Mediterranean mi- grants were identified within these Northeast Atlantic admixture zones no North Atlantic mi- grants were identified respectively in these two neighboring basins. Owing to both, the characterization of larger number of loci and a more ample spatial sampling coverage, it was possible to provide a finer resolution of the boundaries separating Atlantic swordfish populations than previous studies. Finally, the patterns of population structure and admix- ture are discussed in the light of the reproductive biology, the known patterns of dispersal, and oceanographic features that may act as barriers to gene flow to Atlantic swordfish.},

@article{Richardson2010,
	Abstract = {Critical gaps in our understanding of the distributions, interactions, life histories and preferred habitats of large and medium-size pelagic fishes severely constrain the implementation of ecosystem-based, spatially structured fisheries management approaches. In particular, spawning distributions and the environmental characteristics associated with the early life stages are poorly documented. In this study, we consider the diversity, assemblages, and associated habitat of the larvae of large and medium-sized pelagic species collected during 2 years of monthly surveys across the Straits of Florida. In total, 36 taxa and 14,295 individuals were collected, with the highest diversity occurring during the summer and in the western, frontal region of the Florida Current. Only a few species (e.g. Thunnus obesus, T. alalunga, Tetrapturus pfluegeri) considered for this study were absent. Small scombrids (e.g. T. atlanticus, Katsuwonus pelamis, Auxis spp.) and gempylids dominated the catch and were orders of magnitude more abundant than many of the rare species (e.g. Thunnus thynnus, Kajikia albida). Both constrained (CCA) and unconstrained (NMDS) multivariate analyses revealed a number of species groupings including: (1) a summer Florida edge assemblage (e.g. Auxis spp., Euthynnus alleterattus, Istiophorus platypterus); (2) a summer offshore assemblage (e.g. Makaira nigricans, T. atlanticus, Ruvettus pretiosus, Lampris guttatus); (3) an ubiquitous assemblage (e.g. K. pelamis, Coryphaena hippurus, Xiphias gladius); and (4) a spring/winter assemblage that was widely dispersed in space (e.g. trachipterids). The primary environmental factors associated with these assemblages were sea-surface temperature (highest in summer-early fall), day length (highest in early summer), thermocline depth (shallowest on the Florida side) and fluorescence (highest on the Florida side). Overall, the results of this study provide insights into how a remarkable diversity of pelagic species spatially and temporally partition spawning within a region that is characterized by dynamic oceanography and strong habitat gradients. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Swordfish is the target species for harpoon fishery in the Central Mediterranean Sea (southern Tyrrhenian Sea and Strait of Messina). This is a seasonal fishing activity, carried out in daylight during the swordfish's reproductive period. The relationship between sea surface temperature (SST), catches, Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) and fish swimming behaviour, recorded by direct observation, was investigated between 1999 and 2008. Data from AVHRR-SST (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-Sea Surface Temperature), the meteorological station and the swordfish daily catch were recorded. A low presence of pairs was observed in the 2003 summer season, corresponding to an anomalous sea surface temperature recorded in the study area. After 2003, an early presence of pairs (in May rather than in June) was recorded. ANOVA and Bonferroni correction showed significant differences of CPUE of pairs between May and June, and June and August (F3=8.07, P0.0001). The relationship between immature and mature adult specimens, single and in pairs, four ranges of SST, seven swimming behaviours and five maturity stages was analysed by the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Fish in pairs were mainly observed at temperatures over 24 degrees C, showing a well-defined courtship behaviour, i.e. a female route. At lower temperatures, the dominant behaviour was basking in immature fish and breaching in mature fish. A significant relationship between SST and fish behaviour was detected in both immature and mature adult specimens},

	Abstract = {Ecological extinction caused by overfishing precedes all other pervasive human disturbance to coastal ecosystems, including pollution, degradation of water quality, and anthropogenic climate change. Historical abundances of large consumer species were fantastically large in comparison with recent observations. Paleoecological, archaeological, and historical data show that time lags of decades to centuries occurred between the onset of overfishing and consequent changes in ecological communities, because unfished species of similar trophic level assumed the ecological roles of overfished species until they too were overfished or died of epidemic diseases related to overcrowding. Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.},

	Abstract = {The iron-limited Southern Ocean plays an important role in regulating atmospheric CO(2) levels. Marine mammal respiration has been proposed to decrease the efficiency of the Southern Ocean biological pump by returning photosynthetically fixed carbon to the atmosphere. Here, we show that by consuming prey at depth and defecating iron-rich liquid faeces into the photic zone, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) instead stimulate new primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean. We estimate that Southern Ocean sperm whales defecate 50 tonnes of iron into the photic zone each year. Molar ratios of C(export):Fe(added) determined during natural ocean fertilization events are used to estimate the amount of carbon exported to the deep ocean in response to the iron defecated by sperm whales. We find that Southern Ocean sperm whales stimulate the export of 4 × 10(5) tonnes of carbon per year to the deep ocean and respire only 2 × 10(5) tonnes of carbon per year. By enhancing new primary production, the populations of 12 000 sperm whales in the Southern Ocean act as a carbon sink, removing 2 × 10(5) tonnes more carbon from the atmosphere than they add during respiration. The ability of the Southern Ocean to act as a carbon sink may have been diminished by large-scale removal of sperm whales during industrial whaling.},

	Abstract = {As the human population has grown in recent decades, our dependence on ocean-supplied protein has rapidly increased. Kroodsma et al. took advantage of the automatic identification system installed on all industrial fishing vessels to map and quantify fishing efforts across the world (see the Perspective by Poloczanska). More than half of the world{\&}{\#}039;s oceans are subject to industrial-scale harvest, spanning an area four times that covered by terrestrial agriculture. Furthermore, fishing efforts seem not to depend on economic or environmental drivers, but rather social and political schedules. Thus, more active measures will likely be needed to ensure sustainable use of ocean resources.Science, this issue p. 904; see also p. 864Although fishing is one of the most widespread activities by which humans harvest natural resources, its global footprint is poorly understood and has never been directly quantified. We processed 22 billion automatic identification system messages and tracked {\&}gt;70,000 industrial fishing vessels from 2012 to 2016, creating a global dynamic footprint of fishing effort with spatial and temporal resolution two to three orders of magnitude higher than for previous data sets. Our data show that industrial fishing occurs in {\&}gt;55{\%} of ocean area and has a spatial extent more than four times that of agriculture. We find that global patterns of fishing have surprisingly low sensitivity to short-term economic and environmental variation and a strong response to cultural and political events such as holidays and closures.},

	Abstract = {Large predatory fishes have long played an important role in marine ecosystems and fisheries. Overexploitation, however, is gradually diminishing this role. Recent estimates indicate that exploitation has depleted large predatory fish communities worldwide by at least 90{\%} over the past 50-100 years. We demonstrate that these declines are general, independent of methodology, and even higher for sensitive species such as sharks. We also attempt to predict the future prospects of large predatory fishes. (i) An analysis of maximum reproductive rates predicts the collapse and extinction of sensitive species under current levels of fishing mortality. Sensitive species occur in marine habitats worldwide and have to be considered in most management situations. (ii) We show that to ensure the survival of sensitive species in the northwest Atlantic fishing mortality has to be reduced by 40-80{\%}. (iii) We show that rapid recovery of community biomass and diversity usually occurs when fishing mortality is reduced. However, recovery is more variable for single species, often because of the influence of species interactions. We conclude that management of multi-species fisheries needs to be tailored to the most sensitive, rather than the more robust species. This requires reductions in fishing effort, reduction in bycatch mortality and protection of key areas to initiate recovery of severely depleted communities.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that microbes, zooplankton, and fish are important sources of recycled nitrogen in coastal waters, yet marine mammals have largely been ignored or dismissed in this cycle. Using field measurements and population data, we find that marine mammals can enhance primary productivity in their feeding areas by concentrating nitrogen near the surface through the release of flocculent fecal plumes. Whales and seals may be responsible for replenishing 2.3×10(4) metric tons of N per year in the Gulf of Maine's euphotic zone, more than the input of all rivers combined. This upward "whale pump" played a much larger role before commercial harvest, when marine mammal recycling of nitrogen was likely more than three times atmospheric N input. Even with reduced populations, marine mammals provide an important ecosystem service by sustaining productivity in regions where they occur in high densities.},

	Abstract = {There is widespread concern and debate about the state of global marine resources and the ecosystems supporting them, notably global fisheries, as catches now generally stagnate or decline. Many fisheries are not assessed by standard stock assessment methods including many in the world's most biodiverse areas. Though simpler methods using widely available catch data are available, these are often discounted largely because data on fishing effort that contributed to the changes in catches are mostly not considered. We analyse spatial and temporal patterns of global fishing effort and its relationship with catch to assess the status of the world's fisheries. The study reveals that fleets now fish all of the world's oceans and have increased in power by an average of 10-fold (25-fold for Asia) since the 1950s. Significantly, for the equivalent fishing power expended, landings from global fisheries are now half what they were a half-century ago, indicating profound changes to supporting marine environments. This study provides another dimension to understand the global status of fisheries.},

	Abstract = {The tagging of sharks using conventional tags has long been recognized as a valuable means for studying various aspects of their life history, migrations and movements, and population structure. Conventional tags are defined as those that can be identified visually without the use of special detection equipment. Tagging studies specifically targeting sharks began in the late 1920's, and today numerous cooperative shark tagging programs exist worldwide. Cooperative programs depend on the joint participation of scientists and public volunteers to accomplish research objectives. Benefits and problems of these programs are discussed using the tagging methodologies, protocols, and results of the National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program. An additional 63 shark tagging studies and programs of all types are reviewed. Information useful for behavioral, biological, and fishery management studies can be derived from data resulting from these studies, including species and size composition, sex ratios, spatial and temporal distribution, migrations, movement patterns, rates of travel, delineation of pupping grounds, distribution of maturity intervals, indices of relative abundance, and recognition of individuals. Specific tagging experiments can be designed to provide additional data on age and growth, homing and site fidelity, dispersal rate, residence time, movement rates, tag shedding, and population parameters (e.g. size, mortality, recruitment, exploitation, interaction rates, and stock identity). Sources of bias inherent in tagging and recapture data include mortality, variation in tagging effort and fishing pressure, non-recovery and non-reporting of tags, and tag shedding. Recent advances in tagging methodologies that complement and extend conventional tagging studies will further our knowledge on shark movements and migrations, particularly in the areas of resource utilization and management, space utilization, and population dynamics.},
