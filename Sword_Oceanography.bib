abstract = {The spatial distribution of neutral genetic diversity is mainly influenced by barriers to dispersal. The nature of such barriers varies according to the dispersal means and capabilities of the organisms concerned. Although these barriers are often obvious on land, in the ocean they can be more difficult to identify. Determining the relative influence of physical and biotic factors on genetic connectivity remains a major challenge for marine ecologists. Here, we compare gene flow patterns of 7 littoral fish species from 6 families with a range of early-life-history traits sampled at the same geographic locations across common environmental discontinuities in the form of oceanic fronts in the Western Mediterranean. We show that these fronts represent major barriers to gene flow and have a strong influence on the population genetic structure of some fish species. We also found no significant relation between the early-life-history traits most commonly investigated (egg type, pelagic larval duration, and inshore-offshore spawning) and gene flow patterns, suggesting that other life-history factors should deserve attention. The fronts analyzed and the underlying physical mechanisms are not site-specific but common among the oceans, suggesting the generality of our findings. },

abstract = {Throughout the ocean, countless small animals swim to depth in the daytime, presumably to seek refuge from large predators1,2. These animals return to the surface at night to feed1,2. This substantial diel vertical migration can result in the transfer of significant amounts of carbon and nutrients from the surface to depth3–7. However, its consequences on ocean chemistry at the global scale have remained uncertain8,9. Here, we determine the depths of these diel migrations in the global ocean using a global array of backscatter data from acoustic Doppler current profilers, collected between 1990 and 2011. We show that the depth of diel migration follows coherent large-scale patterns. We find that migration depth is greater where subsurface oxygen concentrations are high, such that seawater oxygen concentration is the best single predictor of migration depth at the global scale. In oxygen minimum zone areas, migratory animals generally descend as far as the upper margins of the low-oxygen waters. Using an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general circulation model, we show that by focusing oxygen consumption in poorly ventilated regions of the upper ocean, diel vertical migration intensifies oxygen depletion in the upper margin of oxygen minimum zones. We suggest that future changes in the extent of oxygen minimum zones could alter the migratory depths of marine organisms, with consequences for marine biogeochemistry, foodwebs and fisheries},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that link oceanographic processes and marine vertebrate space use is critical to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning, and for effective management of populations of conservation concern. The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus has been observed in association with oceanographic fronts – physical interfaces at the transitions between water masses – exploiting foraging opportunities resulting from zooplankton aggregation. However, the scale, significance and variability of these associations have not previously been established. Here, we quantify the influence of thermal and chlorophyll-a fronts on basking shark habitat use in the north-east Atlantic. We use animal-mounted archival tracking together with composite front mapping via Earth Observation (EO) remote sensing to provide an oceanographic context to shark movements. We investigate levels of association with fronts occurring over two spatio-temporal scales, (i) broad-scale, seasonally persistent frontal zones and (ii) contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts. Using random walk simulations and logistic regression within an iterative generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework, we find that seasonal front frequency is a significant predictor of shark presence. Oceanographic metrics time-matched to shark tracks indicate that sharks show a preference for productive regions and associate with contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts more frequently than could be expected at random. Moreover, we highlight the importance of front persistence and cross-frontal temperature step, which appear to interact to affect the degree of prey aggregation along thermal fronts in this shelf-sea system. Our findings confirm that surface frontal activity is a predictor of basking shark presence in the north-east Atlantic, both over seasonal timescales and in near real-time. These insights have clear implications for understanding the preferred habitats of basking sharks in the context of anthropogenic threat management and marine spatial planning in the region.},

abstract = {The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) is of high ecological and economic importance to the western Caribbean region, and contains spawning sites for a number of reef fish species. Despite this, little is known of the distribution and transport of pelagic fish larvae in the area, and basic in situ information on larval fish assemblages is lacking. Here we describe the results of two biological oceanography research cruises conducted in winter-spring of 2006 and 2007, focusing on larval fish assemblages. We use multivariate assemblage analyses to examine vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics of larval fish assemblages, to highlight key distinguishing taxa, and to relate these to the observed oceanographic structure. Our results showed a general separation between the Gulf of Honduras region, which was characterized by weaker currents and high abundances of inshore and estuarine taxa (Eleotridae, Priacanthidae), and the northern MBRS, which was subject to strong northward flow and contained a mixture of mesopelagic and reef-associated taxa (Myctophidae, Sparidae). Although distinct patterns of vertical distribution were observed among taxa, both shallow and deep living larvae were broadly distributed throughout the study area. Analysis of historical drifter tracks highlighted the strong northward flow and low retention conditions typically present along the northern MBRS, as well as potential connectivity between the western Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The movement patterns of broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the South Pacific Ocean are largely unknown. Understanding the connectivity of the species across the Pacific and any variability in diving behaviour as it relates to fisheries availability/catchability are of particular relevance. Here, we present an electronic tagging dataset spanning the western and eastern South Pacific Ocean regions. Movements observed suggest a lack of connectivity between the southern and northern regions of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and limited connectivity between the eastern and western parts of the Tasman and Coral Seas in the south-western Pacific Ocean. At least some swordfish appear to undertake movements between tropical waters extending from around Vanuatu to French Polynesia to waters around New Zealand, indicating greater connectivity than previously thought. Observations indicate no movement between the WCPO and the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), although data from boundary areas are lacking. Swordfish demonstrated a mixture of diel vertical distributions and daytime surface behaviour, spending time mostly in waters {\textless}. 100. m during the night and {\textgreater}. 400. m during the day. Diel vertical movements resulted in movement through water temperatures that varied on the order of 15-20°. C with temperatures at depth as low as 2.4°. C and those at the surface as high as 31.4°. C. Vertical distributions of swordfish varied both spatially and temporally with swordfish in the Tasman/Coral Seas demonstrating the least variability. Spatio-temporal variability in vertical distributions is likely driven by variability in environmental conditions and associated prey distributions. Swordfish tagged in the Tasman/Coral Seas and in the EPO interrupted deeper daytime distributions with two distinct types of surfacing behaviour: temporally associated and temporally isolated. Temporally isolated surface behaviour occurred throughout the year and in association with on average lower sea surface temperatures. Temporally associated surface behaviour was restricted to austral summer months only and in association with on average higher sea surface temperatures. Our results represent a major step towards reducing uncertainty about the spatial dynamics of swordfish in the South Pacific Ocean. At the same time, questions as to the extent of connectivity of swordfish throughout the south Pacific and the linkages between spawning ground and foraging ground locations are raised. Further investigation of the movements of swordfish from the central southern Pacific Ocean is required to determine what linkages there may be between the WCPO and the EPO and whether connectivity suggested by genetic studies is supported. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, in the case of the two Atlantic swordfish stocks occurring in the North and South Atlantic, those stocks have rebuilt to the BMSY objective of the responsible RFMO, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The relative contribution of the management actions of the RFMO and biological characteristics of swordfish stocks are evaluated in relation to the recovery of the stocks. It is concluded that while swordfish have characteristics that promote stock resilience (including relatively fast growth, and spatially- and temporally-dispersed spawning), positive management actions combined with a period of relatively good recruitmentwere essential to achieve the rebuilt outcome. The challenges that the RFMO faces to maintain the stocks in the rebuilt condition are described, and some possible additional measures discussed.},

@article{Seki2002,
abstract = {During January-May, surface manifestation of multiple, individual basin-scale fronts accentuate the central North Pacific Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ) system. The most prominent of these fronts are climatologically located at 32degrees-34degreesN and at 28degrees-30degreesN latitudes [herein nominally referred to as the 'Subtropical Front' (STF) and the 'South Subtropical Front' (SSTF), respectively], although considerable interannual variability in both position and intensity is observed. This seasonally dynamic system is also the region typically targeted by the Hawaii-based swordfish (Xiphias gladius ) longline fishing fleet, where the presence, position, and strength of the convergent fronts are believed to play a key role with regard to the catch and catch rates of swordfish. Information furnished by a recent series of meridional hydrographic surveys and concurrent satellite remote sensing data elucidate structural patterns and coupling of the physics and biology associated with these fronts. This enables a re-characterization of the spring North Pacific STFZ and offers new insight into the seasonal variability of the phytoplankton dynamics in the subtropical North Pacific. On synoptic time scales, geographical positioning of the fronts may be systematically identified through surface outcropping of diagnostic thermohaline isopleths and therefore readily discerned from both shipboard surveys and by spaceborne sensors. The STF during spring can be characterized by the surface expression of the 34.8 isohaline and the 17degreesC isotherm within the frontal gradient. Biologically, the STF marks the transition from low chloropigment (chlorophyll + phaeopigments), nutrient-depleted surface waters to the south to a more productive regime to the north. To the south, the 20degreesC and 35.0 surface isotherm and isohaline, respectively, are characteristically embedded in the thermohaline gradients associated with the SSTF. A sharp increase in depth-integrated chloropigment is also observed at the SSTF and is ascribed to an increase in the concentration and thickness of the subsurface chloropigment maximum (SCM) prompted by the shoaling of the nutricline with the thermocline structure into the euphotic zone.},

abstract = {Although bluefin tuna are found throughout the Atlantic Ocean, spawning in the western Atlantic has been recorded predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in spring. Larval bluefin tuna abundances from the northern GOM are formulated into an index used to tune the adult stock assessment, and the var- iability of this index is currently high. This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval bluefin tuna abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval bluefin tuna catch locations, and a suite of environ- mental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, would be more likely to contain bluefin tuna larvae. Favorable habitat for bluefin tuna larvae was defined using a classification tree approach. Habitat within the Loop Current was generally less favorable, as were warm- core rings, and cooler waters on the continental shelf. The location and size of favorable habitat was highly variable among years, which was reflected in the locations of larval bluefin tuna catches. The model successfully placed bluefin tuna larvae in favorable habitat with nearly 90{\%} accuracy, but many negative stations were also located within theoretically favor- able habitat. The probability of collecting larval bluefin tuna in favorable habitat was nearly twice the probability of collecting bluefin tuna larvae across all habitats (35.5 versus 21.0{\%}). This model is a useful addition to knowledge of larval bluefin tuna distributions; however, the incorporation of variables describing finer-scale features, such as thermal fronts, may significantly improve the model's predictive power.},

abstract = {The Gulf Stream region contains strong mesoscale variability that significantly influences planktonic ecosystems residing therein. Meanders of the Gulf Stream can be identified as eastward propagating features in maps of sea level anomaly. These meanders can become unstable and pinch off to form nonlinear mesoscale eddies (rings) that trap large parcels of water. Following formation, ecosystems trapped within these eddies are subjected to temporally varying vertical velocities throughout their lifetime. As a result of both horizontal advection and vertical fluxes, multiple physical-biological mechanisms can simultaneously influence phytoplankton communities trapped in eddies. In this study we examine how the near-surface chlorophyll field (CHL) evolves in meanders and eddies by comparing satellite observations with an eddy-resolving ocean model. Prior in situ and satellite observations have revealed that during the formation of cyclonic Gulf Stream meanders, water with elevated CHL is transported southward. In anticyclonic meanders, water with reduced CHL is transported northward. Alternating submesoscale patches of upwelling and downwelling occur along the meandering front; however, evidence of a biological response to meander-induced vertical motion was not observed in meander-centric composite averages. During the formation of nonlinear Gulf Stream eddies, elevated and suppressed CHL is trapped and subsequently transported westward in cyclones and anticyclones, respectively. Following formation, CHL is observed to increase in the cores of anticyclones. The observed positive trend in CHL in anticyclones is consistent with the influence of eddy-induced Ekman pumping (eddy/wind interaction) that generates upwelling in anticyclones and downwelling in cyclones. To substantiate the influence of eddy-induced Ekman pumping on CHL in Gulf Stream eddies, two separate eddy-resolving physical-biological simulations are compared. The first simulation is forced with a realistic surface stress that includes the influence of ocean surface currents. The second simulation neglects this process. The time evolution of CHL within eddies is very different in these two simulations. The model that includes eddy-induced Ekman pumping generates temporal trends in CHL that are similar to the observations.},

Stomachs were collected from 86 swordfish. The diet was analysed in terms of prey occurrence, relative abundance, reconstituted mass, and size distribution. It consisted mainly of fish, 40.5{\%} by mass ({\%}M) and cephalopods, 59.3{\%}M; crustaceans, 0.2{\%}M, were considered secondary prey. When considering only the fresh fraction to allow for differential digestion rates, these figures were 77.3{\%}M, 22.7{\%}M, and trace amounts, respectively. Lanternfish, including Notoscopelus kroeyeri and Symbolophorus veranyi, were abundant, but paralepidids, Atlantic pomfret (Brama brama), and the squid Todarodes sagittatus, Ommastrephes bartramii, and Gonatus steenstrupi, dominated the diet by mass. The overall prey size range was 11-1420 mm, but sizes of 60-360 mm accounted for 80{\%} of the distribution by number and of 140-760 mm for 80{\%} of the distribution by mass. Intraspecifically, larger swordfish ate larger prey as a result of a change in species composition of the diet. The swordfish appears to show feeding plasticity both between different areas and between animals in the same area. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is the primary spawning ground for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). In this work, information reported by previous studies about the preferred environmental conditions for the occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae in the GOM is integrated into a dimensionless index, the BFT{\_}Index. This index is used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae within the GOM during 1993–2011. The main findings of this work are that: (i) the proposed index successfully captures the spatial and temporal variability in the in situ occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae; (ii) areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae in the GOM exhibit year-to-year spatial and temporal variability linked with mesoscale ocean features and sea surface temperature; and (iii) comparison of the BFT{\_}Index derived variability with recruitment of age-0 fish estimated from recent stock assessment indicates that changes in environmental conditions may drive a relevant component ({\~{}}58{\%}) of the recruitment variability. The comparison with the recruitment dataset further revealed the existence of key regions linked with recruitment in the central/northern GOM, and that the Loop Current may function as a trap for larvae, possibly leading to low survival rates. Above (below) average conditions for occurrence of larvae in the GOM during spring were observed in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006–2008, and 2011 (1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2010). Results reported here have potential applications to assessment of bluefin tuna.},

abstract = {The ocean is a dynamic environment inhabited by a diverse array of highly migratory species, many of which are under direct exploitation in targeted fisheries. The time- scales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and eco- logical forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990–2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the Cali- fornia drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence–absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regio- nal Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Sword- fish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters ({\textgreater}1,500 m) with surface temperatures in the 14–20°C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20–40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon ({\textless}20{\%} lunar illumination).We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence–absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotempo- rally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.},

abstract = {Conflicting trends in indices of abundance for North Atlantic swordfish starting in the mid-to late 1990s, in the form of fleet specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), suggest the possibility of a spatial shift in abundance to follow areas of preferred temperature. The observed changes in the direction of the CPUEs correspond with changes in trends in the summer Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a long term mode of variability of North Atlantic sea surface temperature. To test the hypothesis of a relation between the CPUE and the AMO, the CPUEs were made spatially explicit by re-estimating using an "areas-as-fleets" approach. These new CPUEs were then used to create alternative stock histories. The residuals of the fit were then regressed against the summer AMO. Significant, and opposite, relations were found in the regressions between eastern and western Atlantic areas. When the AMO was in a warm phase, the CPUEs in the western (eastern) areas were higher (lower) than predicted by the assessment model fit. Given the observed temperature tolerance limits of swordfish, it is possible that either their preferred habitat, prey species, or both have shifted spatial distributions resulting in conflicting CPUE indices. Because the available CPUE time series only overlaps with one change in the sign of the AMO ({\~{}}1995), it is not clear whether this is a directional or cyclical trend. Given the relatively localized nature of many of the fishing fleets, and the difficulty of separating fleet effects from changes in oceanography we feel that it is critical to create CPUE indices by combining data across similar fleets that fish in similar areas. This approach allowed us to evaluate area-specific catch rates which provided the power to detect basin-wide responses to changing oceanography, a critical step for providing robust management advice in a changing climate.},

abstract = {A newly developed hybrid-coordinate ocean circulation model is documented and tested. Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables (??, S versus T, S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A large-scale bias adjustment of the input infrared SSTs is made using buoy and ship observations as a reference. This is particularly important for the time periods when volcanic aerosols from the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions are widespread globally.

abstract = {1. Electronic tagging of marine fishes is commonly achieved with archival tags that rely on light levels and sea surface temperatures to retrospectively estimate movements. However, methodological issues associated with light-level geolocation have constrained meaningful inference to species where it is possible to accurately estimate time of sunrise and sunset. Most studies have largely ignored the oceanographic profiles collected by the tag as a potential way to refine light-level geolocation estimates. 2. Open-source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high-resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. 3. The R package HMMoce leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. 4. HMMoce exhibited as much as 6-fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light-level geolocation approaches. The results demonstrated the general applicability of HMMoce to marine animals, particularly those that do not frequent surface waters during crepuscular periods.},

abstract = {The efficiency of a pelagic longline fishing operation and the species composition of the resulting catch is influenced primarily by the relationship between the distribution of hooks and species vulnerability, with vulnerability described by either depth or some suite of environmental variables. We therefore fitted longline catch rate models to determine whether catch is estimated better by vertically distributing a species by depth or by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, thermocline gradient, and oxygen concentration). Catch rates were estimated by two methods: (i) monitoring longlines where the vertical distribution of hooks and catch in relation to depth and environmental conditions is known, and (ii) applying a statistical habitat-based standardization (statHBS) model to fishery and environmental data to develop relative abundance indices for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Results indicated that an understanding of gear dynamics and environmental influences are important for analyzing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data correctly. Analyses based on depth-specific catch rates can lead to serious misinterpretation of abundance trends, despite the use of sophisticated statistical techniques (e.g., generalized linear mixed models). This illustrates that inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of important covariates can bias estimates of relative abundance, which may be a common occurrence in CPUE analysis.},

The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the surface stress with the surface current vorticity gradient, resulting in dipoles of Ekman upwelling and downwelling. The third mechanism arises from eddy-induced spatial variability of sea surface temperature (SST), which generates a curl of the stress and therefore Ekman pumping in regions of crosswind SST gradients. The spatial structures and relative magnitudes of the three contributions to eddy-induced Ekman pumping are investigated by collocating satellite-based measurements of SST, geostrophic velocity, and surface winds to the interiors of eddies identified from their sea surface height signatures.

The significance of the Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ), an important oceanographic feature in the southern Sargasso Sea, is highlighted. Albacore tuna are shown to spawn in March and April between 20°- 23{\textordmasculine} N. and 60°-70{\textordmasculine} W. in proximity to the STCZ. Female swordfish in spawning condition were sampled from a larger latitudinal range (18°- 25{\textordmasculine} N.) and further east (55°- 65{\textordmasculine} W.). Swordfish spawning occurs from December to June within the subtropical area (13°–35° N.), but it appears that the southern Sargasso Sea is one of the areas of more intense reproduction. White marlin spawn in essentially the same area as albacore from April to June. The overlap of the spawning areas between the three species during similar time periods and in proximity to the STCZ suggests that some management/conservation measures should be considered to protect the spawning stocks in this area. An analysis of the ICCAT catch records for these three species for the southern Sargasso Sea (20°-30{\textordmasculine} N.) indicates that the catches from this zone are not generally a significant contributor to the catches from the Sargasso Sea as a whole.},

abstract = {Hydrographic data from two oceanographic cruises conducted during March 2006 and January/February 2007 are used to investigate the thermohaline structure related to the observed circulation along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). From our observations we identify three water masses in the MBRS: the Caribbean Surface Water (CSW), North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater (SUW), and Tropical Atlantic Central Water (TACW). Little vertical structure in temperature is observed in the upper 100 m of the water column, but important differences are observed in the salinity distribution both horizontally and with depth. Freshwater inputs to the system from the mainland can be traced in the surface layer, with two possible sources: one from surface rivers located along the southern portion of the MBRS, and the other originating from an underground river system located along the northern portion of the MBRS. The thermohaline structure in the MBRS reflects the dynamics of the observed circulation. Uplifted isopycnals along most of the central and northern coastline of the MBRS reflect the effects of the strong geostrophic circulation flowing northward, i.e. the Yucatan Current. To the south along the MBRS, much weaker velocities are observed, with the Honduras Gyre dominating the flow in this region as presented during January/February 2007. These two regions are separated by onshore and divergent alongshore flow associated with the impingement of the Cayman Current on the shore and the MBRS.},

abstract = {The capacity of the Azores Archipelago to capture and retain incoming particles and organisms that are drifting with the oceanic currents was the main focus of this study. Using the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model coupled with the Connectivity Modeling System (an offline Lagrangian tool) a series of experiments were conducted to determine: i) the origin of the particles that reach the archipelago, ii) the capacity of each island sub-group to retain incoming particles and organisms, as well as the iii) oceanographic phenomena that lead to their transport and retention. The Gulf Stream (GS) and the westward propagating eddy corridors were identified as the main transport pathways affecting the Azores region. Eddy Kinetic Energy from altimetry data and Lyapunov exponent analysis suggest that eddies and filaments are the main delivery mechanisms. In the upper mixed layer, the GS and its associated eddies are a predominant regional oceanographic feature injecting particles from the north and west boundaries toward the Azores. The capacity to capture particles of each island sub-group was directly proportional to their size, while the retention time within the Azores region increased with depth, associated with the decrease in velocity of the intermediate water currents. This study opens new prospects to understand transport in the Mid-Atlantic (Azores) region and the islands' role in marine colonization, dispersal, fisheries recruitment and speciation.},

The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses.

abstract = {The direct ocean current observations across the Yucatan Channel collected during the Canek program allow the best description to date of the exchange between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. A net transport of 23.8 ± 1 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s1; 95{\%} confidence interval) flowed through the Yucatan Channel from the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico, during the period between September 1999 and June 2000. This is about 20 percent less than the 30 Sv accepted as the nominal transport of the Florida Current, and less also than the 28 Sv assumed for Yucatan in closing the transport budgets for Caribbean passages. The discrepancy may be an imbalance due to fluctuations in the transports through other passages of the system, especially the Old Bahama and Northwest Providence Channels, which remain poorly known. Our data corroborate the principal features of the flow through the Yucatan Channel: The northerly surface Yucatan Current and its southerly Under-current off Mexico, and the southerly surface Cuban Counter-current near Cuba; but previously unobserved mean currents are found to exist at depth, especially on the eastern side of the channel. Fluctuations seen in the deep flows are related to volume anomalies over the Gulf of Mexico. A transport through the Yucatan Channel smaller than previously thought has significant implications for the dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico and its modeling, since this transport is the principal forcing of its circulation. The circulation budgets in the Western Subtropical Atlantic should be revised considering these new results. INDEX},

abstract = {Guidelines for the assessment and management of developing swordfish fisheries are derived through an examination of five swordfish fisheries. As they develop, swordfish fisheries may be inclined to local depletion around underwater features, such as seamounts and banks. Few nations have applied the precautionary approach in managing their developing swordfish fisheries. Without controls, swordfish fisheries expand geographically and fishing effort increases, often overshooting optimum levels. However, it is difficult to distinguish clear evidence of fishery collapse; modern longliners harvest widely distributed tuna and swordfish and they are able to relocate to distant areas or switch between target species in response to fluctuations in species abundance and price. Furthermore, the wide distribution of swordfish combined with year-round spawning and high growth rates amongst juveniles probably contribute to the apparent resilience of swordfish stocks to intensive harvesting. Over half the world's swordfish catch is taken as an incidental catch of longliners fishing for tuna. In several areas, such as the North Atlantic, catch quotas have sometimes caused tuna longline fishers to discard swordfish. Minimum size limits have also resulted in discarding of swordfish in tuna fisheries and in dedicated swordfish fisheries. In addition to weakening the effectiveness of those management measures, bycatch and discarding add to the complexities of managing swordfish fisheries and to uncertainties in assessing the stocks. Longliners that target swordfish often fish at high latitudes where interactions with marine wildlife, such as seabird, are generally more frequent than at low latitudes. Concern over incidental catches of marine wildlife and other species is becoming a driving force in the management of several swordfish fisheries. Fishery management organisations will need to implement management measures to protect non-target species and gather reliable data and information on the situation by placing observers on boats fishing for swordfish.},

abstract = {Fronts and eddies are widely hypothesized to be critical spawning habitat for large pelagic fishes, due to increased larval and/or adult feeding opportunities at these features. We examined sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) spawning around a cyclonic, submesoscale (∼13 × 7 km) Florida Current frontal eddy. The temporal progression of eddy dynamics over a 65 h period was determined using ocean color satellite imagery, continuous surface measurements along the cruise track, and non-linear least-squares fitting of the positions of three drifters deployed within the eddy. A peak in larval sailfish densities (n = 2435, stations = 49), composed primarily of yolk-sac and first-feeding larvae, occurred at the eddy frontal zone. A majority of these larvae were estimated to have been spawned during the formation of the eddy. A comparison between the distribution of similar-age sailfish and scombrid larvae indicated that the peak in larval sailfish density likely resulted from spawning directly at the front, rather than transport by convergent flow. The first-feeding prey items of larval sailfish (Farranula and Corycaeus copepods) were most abundant at the frontal zone and to a lesser extent inside the eddy. Egg distributions were used to indirectly assess the distribution of adult sailfish prey items. Euthynnus alleteratus and Auxis spp. eggs were in highest abundance outside the eddy, while the eggs of small carangids were in highest abundance at the eddy frontal zone. Overall, this study indicates that sailfish spawn at small-scale oceanographic features that provide a favorable feeding environment for their larvae and potentially also for the adults. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Their influence on biological and biogeochemical processes varies widely, stemming not only from advective transport but also from the generation of variations in the environment that affect biological and chemical rates. The ephemeral nature of mesoscale features in the ocean makes it difficult to elucidate the attendant mechanisms of physical-biological-biogeochemical interaction, necessitating the use of multidisciplinary approaches involving in situ observations, remote sensing, and modeling.

abstract = {The surface and sub-surface biological oceanography of tuna fishing grounds within the East Australian Current (EAC) was compared in 2004 with two other fishing areas further offshore. Our aim was to determine whether the biological oceanography of the region could explain the distribution and intensity of pelagic fishery catches inside and outside the EAC at that time. The EAC fishing area was noticeably warmer, less saline and lower in nutrients than waters in the other fishing areas. The EAC waters were dominated by large diatoms, the biomass of which was significantly higher than in the seamount and offshore areas, apparently the result of a cold core eddy beneath the EAC surface filament. Over the seamount and offshore more typical Tasman Sea waters prevailed, although the presence of a relatively deeper oxygen minimum layer over the seamount suggested topographically induced mixing in the area. Notably, sub-surface zooplankton and micronekton biomass was significantly higher around the seamount than in the two other areas. The offshore region was characterised by frontal activity associated with the Tasman front. Micronekton net biomass was generally highest in surface waters in this region. Examination of tuna catch records at that time showed yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) dominated the catches of the EAC, whereas swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) were the main species caught offshore. We suggest the yellowfin tuna concentrate in waters that are not only warmer but where prey species are concentrated near the surface. Offshore, deeper living species such as swordfish and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) can take advantage of prey species that are distributed deeper in the water column and along the flanks of the many seamounts in the region, or that are concentrated at fronts associated with the Tasman Front. Although only a snapshot of the region, relatively consistent catch data over time suggests the underlying biological oceanography may persist over longer time periods, particularly during the Austral spring. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Bycatch mitigation approaches aim to either reduce the incidence of unwanted catch or reduce bycatch mortalities. In pelagic longline fisheries incidence of unwanted catch can be reduced by limiting the availability of baited hooks (e.g., within bycatch species' preferred depths and water temperatures), whereas bycatch mortalities can be decreased by gear modifications and changes to fishing practices, e.g., by limiting soak time. To evaluate the effects of temperature, depth, and soak time on catch of target and bycatch species, temperature recorders were set along the length of the longline to characterize the environment at which hooks were fishing. Although few instrumented sets were fished, observations at the within set scale - specifically, that swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch did not increase with longer soak times - led us to reexamine assumptions made in fleet-wide catch models. Swordfish catch did not increase with soak time in generalized linear models based on fisheries observer data collected from swordfish-targeted sets fished by the Canadian pelagic longline fleet in 2008 and 2009 (n = 42 and n = 78, respectively). Minimum soak time, from end of setting to start of hauling, was used in swordfish catch models. Total soak time is inappropriate for catch models because it includes haulback time, which increases as a function of catch. If landed catch does not increase as a function of soak time, then limiting longline soak time to reduce bycatch mortalities would not cause decreased swordfish catch nor result in economic losses for fishers. While minimum soak time limits would likely decrease bycatch mortality rates in swordfish longline fisheries, impacts on other aspects of the fishing process would need to be considered, such as negative impacts on fisher safety. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

To date, these data have not been analyzed in terms of assemblage structure or variability, despite representing a highly valuable resource for examining decadal-scale change. In this study, multivariate statistical techniques were used to characterize temporal and spatial changes in abundances of the larvae of 20 common fish families from the early 1980s through to the late 2000s. The larvae of some pelagic and mesopelagic families showed marked increases in abundance over the survey time period, while the abundances of some benthic families decreased. Changes in assemblage structure were partially explained by changes in the Gulf of Mexico environment with respect to sea surface temperature and changes in shrimp trawling effort. Outflow from the Mississippi River was also influential on the interannual assemblage variability. However, the strong directional trends apparent in many family groups remained unexplained, and further research is required to discern the drivers of these patterns.},

abstract = {In species with high migratory potential, the genetic signal revealing population differentiation is often obscured by population admixture. To our knowledge, the explicit comparison of genetic samples from known spawning and feeding areas has not been conducted for any highly migratory pelagic fish species. This study examines the geographic heterogeneity of swordfish mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages within the Atlantic Ocean using 330 base pairs of sequence of the control region from 480 individuals. Hierarchical analyses of sequence variation were conducted to test whether samples from areas identified as the corresponding spawning and feeding grounds for the northwest (NW) Atlantic (Caribbean and Georges Banks-US northeast) and the South Atlantic (Brazil-Uruguay and Gulf of Guinea), were more closely related to each other than to samples from any other region, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. Phylogeographic analyses reveal that swordfish mtDNA phylogeny is characterized by incomplete lineage sorting and secondary contact of two highly divergent clades. However, despite this complex phylogenetic signature, results from an analysis of nucleotide diversity and from an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were for the most part concordant and indicate that NW Atlantic and South Atlantic swordfish belong to separate populations. The mtDNA distinctiveness of NW Atlantic and South Atlantic swordfish populations is indicative of philopatric behavior in swordfish towards breeding and feeding areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Catch-and-effort data from a longline vessel operating off the west coast of Portugal, and thermal imagery from NOAA satellites were employed to investigate the aggregation and availability of swordfish, bigeye and albacore tuna in relation to transient coastal upwelling features. We found a decreasing trend in swordfish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and an increasing trend in tuna species CPUE during the study period in apparent association with the progressively increasing intensity of the coastal upwelling regime from year to year. Swordfish CPUE were significantly higher on the warm side of surface thermal fronts associated with events of intensification/relaxation of coastal upwelling. The fishing efficiency for tuna species was significantly higher during peak upwelling conditions, in the close vicinity of mushroom-like structures at the edge of upwelling filaments. The present results do not support the existence of a preferred sea surface temperature (SST) range for these fish species. It is suggested that several mechanisms leading to the local concentration of prey provide adequate explanations for the aggregation of these species in the vicinity of frontal structures associated with coastal upwelling processes. },

abstract = {An algorithm is described for oceanic front detection in chlorophyll (Chl) and sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery. The algorithm is based on a gradient approach: the main novelty is a shape-preserving, scale-sensitive, contextual median filter applied selectively and iteratively until convergence. This filter has been developed specifically for Chl since these fields have spatial patterns such as chlorophyll enhancement at thermohaline fronts and small- and meso-scale chlorophyll blooms that are not present in SST fields. Linear Chl enhancements and localized (point-wise) blooms are modeled as ridges and peaks respectively, whereas conventional fronts in Chl and SST fields are modeled as steps or ramps. Examples are presented of the algorithm performance using modeled (synthetic) images as well as synoptic Chl and SST imagery. After testing, the algorithm was used on {\textgreater} 6000 synoptic images, 1999-2007, to produce climatologies of Chl and SST fronts off the U.S. Northeast. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An archival tag equipped with sensors for temperature, depth and luminous intensity is an excellent method to elucidate behaviour and migration of marine organisms. Herein, what we believe is the first successful archival tag experiment with swordfish in the world is reported. The swordfish, which was harpooned with an archival tag encased in a plastic capsule, was released in July 1999 off the east coast of Japan. The fish was recaptured by a harpoon fishing vessel in June 2000, only 103 km from the tagging location and weighed approximately 120-kg. By comparing the water temperature data of the archival tag with oceanographic data, a cyclic seasonal migration between the food-rich Oyashio cold current area (40-45degreesN) during summer and the subtropical wintering area (10-20degreesN) was suggested. During most of the days of observation and for the majority of the time within a day, tagged fish swam in cold water (3-6degreesC) and deeper than approximately 200 m; at night, fish generally stayed near the warmer surface waters (21-27degreesC). The greatest swimming depth was approximated to be 900 m, deduced from ambient water temperature data. The swimming depth and behaviour pattern changed in response to the ambient water temperature.},

Data from nine tags (range: 1–292 days; mean: 89 days) revealed (i) pronounced north–south movements in pelagic waters between areas including Georges Bank, Mid- and South Atlantic Bight, Caribbean Sea, and Brazilian shelf, (ii) a lack of east–west exchange, and (iii) a high-use area in the Hatteras Plain, centered southwest of Bermuda. Bigeye tuna occupied water masses of 2.7–28.2 °C and depths of 0–1280 m, with deeper depths in the daytime (daily mean ± standard deviation: 196 ± 92 m) than at nighttime (45 ± 29 m). Even though bigeye tuna are assumed to forage on the deep scattered layer during the day, generalized additive mixed models did not identify the deep scattered layer as an important predictor of daytime swimming depth. Model results highlight the importance of geographic location in influencing habitat utilization, and thus suggest the need for fisheries-independent monitoring in high-catch areas, such as the central and equatorial Atlantic.},

abstract = {Large and powerful ocean predators such as swordfishes, some tunas, and several shark species are unique among fishes in that they are capable of maintaining elevated body temperatures (endothermy) when hunting for prey in deep and cold water [1–3]. In these animals, warming the central nervous system and the eyes is the one common feature of this energetically costly adaptation [4]. In the swordfish (Xiphias gladius), a highly specialized heating system located in an extraocular muscle specifically warms the eyes and brain up to 10°C–15°C above ambient water temperatures [2, 5]. Although the function of neural warming in fishes has been the subject of considerable speculation [1, 6, 7], the biological significance of this unusual ability has until now remained unknown. We show here that warming the retina significantly improves temporal resolution, and hence the detection of rapid motion, in fast-swimming predatory fishes such as the swordfish. Depending on diving depth, temporal resolution can be more than ten times greater in these fishes than in fishes with eyes at the same temperature as the surrounding water. The enhanced temporal resolution allowed by heated eyes provides warm-blooded and highly visual oceanic predators, such as swordfishes, tunas, and sharks, with a crucial advantage over their agile, cold-blooded prey.},

This includes data on individuals tagged and recaptured by our TP as well as sharks tagged by foreign laboratories and later recovered and reported through our TP. A total of 2435 sharks were recaptured, 2208 of which were sharks tagged by other countries. A total de 154 recaptures came from 4662 sharks released during opportunistic tagging activities carried out on board Spanish longliners, while 73 recaptures were from 918 sharks released during two scientific tagging surveys conducted in the North Atlantic areas. Recapture rates were 3.3{\%} and 7.9 {\%}, respectively, depending on the type of tagging done. The longest periods at large were 3847 and 3843 days for species Isurus oxyrhinchus (IOO) and Prionace glauca (PGO), respectively. The results would suggest that there are migratory patterns partially dependent on the tagging strategies used by the different countries and on the spatial and temporal pattern of the fishing effort carried out by the fleet reporting the recaptures. The overall recaptures show that the two species move over a wide range, but no transoceanic movements were detected. This would suggest that movements are limited to within each hemisphere. PGO data from the North Atlantic indicate that these sharks migrate between temperate and warm-water zones, with an apparent border curbing these migratory movements around regions of the Equator. Aspects related to the standardisation of the tagging-recapture protocols used by the different countries are also discussed. R{\'{E}}SUM{\'{E}}},

abstract = {A total of 21 swordfish, Xiphias gladius, were tagged with pop-up satellite tags in northern and southeastern areas of the North Atlantic Ocean. There were seasonal patterns in the horizontal movements, with fish tagged in the central North Atlantic moving southwards from the end of the year, generally south of 25??N, and returning to the temperate foraging grounds, north of 40??N, in spring. Although movements mainly took place latitudinally, fish tracks showed connectivity between the north central, north western, south eastern and north eastern North Atlantic. Average estimated daily displacements were 24.7??19.5kmday-1, and could average up to {\~{}}100kmday-1 in some months. The longest track recorded totaled more than 10,000km. Swordfish showed remarkable physiological versatility, inhabiting waters with SSTs ranging from 10.1 to 28.6??C, and subject to environmental temperatures of c. 4??C-28?? C, with daily ranges frequently over 15??C (mean 9.2??5.7). Fish showed a clear diel pattern in vertical behavior, feeding at 300-600m deep during daytime and staying in the mixed layer at night. There was a significant relationship between nocturnal depth and moonphase, quarter and sea surface temperature. The results of the present study are in agreement with the current separation between North Atlantic, Mediterranean and South Atlantic stocks, but suggest that the assumption of a single homogeneous stock in the North Atlantic might be overly simplistic. Further tagging studies, with special emphasis in areas and seasons not covered so far and in combination with other techniques, are still needed to elucidate the uncertainties of Atlantic swordfish stock structure.},

abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are capable of storing high-resolution behavioral and environmental information for extended periods of time (approximately 1 year), rendering them especially valuable for studying highly mobile species. In this review, we synthesize published PSAT data to understand the biophysical drivers that influence movements of billfishes (families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae). To date, over 1,080 PSATs have been deployed on billfishes, with individuals demonstrating both trans-equatorial and trans-basin movements. Using this dataset, we identify four main physical variables that drive billfish behavior: temperature, light, oxygen, and complex water mixing (e.g. fronts and eddies). Of the seven species that have been studied with PSAT technology, all exhibited a strong thermal preference for water {\textgreater}22°C, though vertically migrating swordfish additionally occupied waters {\textless}10°C while at depth. Ambient light levels influence vertical movements, especially those associated with foraging, as billfish possess large eyes and thermoregulatory abilities that facilitate feeding behaviors below warm surface layers. Mounting evidence suggests that some billfishes actively avoid regions with low dissolved oxygen ({\textless}3.5 mL L¿1). Human-induced climate change is expected to increase the horizontal and vertical extent of hypoxic water and may further compress habitat and concentrate fishing pressure on pelagic fishes. Finally, complex submeso- and mesoscale processes provide critical habitat for spawning, larval feeding, and retention, but our understanding of these and other behavioral aspects of billfish biology remains limited. Future research efforts should leverage technical advancements while integrating existing and future tag data with chemical and physical oceanographic datasets to gain a better understanding of the relevant biophysical interactions for billfishes, thereby enhancing management capabilities for this ecologically and economically important group of fishes.},

abstract = {Meso- and submesoscales (fronts, eddies, filaments) in surface ocean flow have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics partly control the foraging behavior and the displacement of marine top predators (tuna, birds, turtles, and cetaceans). In this work we focus on the role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird. Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs. The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric current changes over the structures to move along these biologic corridors. The birds being often associated with tuna schools around foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of their foraging behavior and movement during the breeding season is crucial not only to seabird ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach to fisheries in the channel.},

abstract = {Overfishing is arguably the greatest ecological threat facing the oceans, yet catches of many highly migratory fishes including oceanic sharks remain largely unregulated with poor monitoring and data reporting. Oceanic shark conservation is hampered by basic knowledge gaps about where sharks aggregate across population ranges and precisely where they overlap with fishers. Using satellite tracking data from six shark species across the North Atlantic, we show that pelagic sharks occupy predictable habitat hotspots of high space use. Movement modeling showed sharks preferred habitats characterized by strong sea surface-temperature gradients (fronts) over other available habitats. However, simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of the entire Spanish and Portuguese longline-vessel fishing fleets show an 80{\%} overlap of fished areas with hotspots, potentially increasing shark susceptibility to fishing exploitation. Regions of high overlap between oceanic tagged sharks and longliners included the North Atlantic Current/Labrador Current convergence zone and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge southwest of the Azores. In these main regions, and subareas within them, shark/vessel co-occurrence was spatially and temporally persistent between years, highlighting how broadly the fishing exploitation efficiently “tracks” oceanic sharks within their space-use hotspots year-round. Given this intense focus of longliners on shark hotspots, our study argues the need for international catch limits for pelagic sharks and identifies a future role of combining fine-scale fish and vessel telemetry to inform the ocean-scale management of fisheries.},

abstract = {Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction (GRASP) was used to map the spatial distribution of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the South Atlantic. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to relate catch to environmental predictor variables. Catch information from 38,000 Brazilian pelagic longline sets from 1980 to 2000 and size frequency data from 5000 longline sets from 1982 to 2000 were obtained from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT). Results highlight the importance of environmental variables for the fishery and for the spatial distribution of different size classes of swordfish (small, intermediate and large). The distribution of swordfish was closely associated with convergence zones (inter-tropical and sub-tropical), especially in the months of greatest convergence intensity. Spatial distribution patterns differed for the three studied size classes. The smallest size classes were found mainly in coastal zones and in areas with a shallow mixed layer ({\textless}20 m). In contrast intermediate-sized swordfish were mostly associated with the inter-tropical convergence and mixed layers of more than 20 m depth and large swordfish were often found in the vicinity of the sub-tropical convergence zone and in areas with mixed layers of less than 25 m and greater than 60 m. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

During the same 13-year period, 103 anticyclonic eddies and 269 cyclonic eddies were detected by our algorithm in the region 30-55°N, 30-80°W. Our results show that tuna and swordfish catches were associated with different eddy structures. Bluefin tuna catch was highest in anticyclonic eddies whereas yellowfin and bigeye tuna catches were highest in cyclonic eddies. Swordfish catch was found preferentially in regions outside of eddies. Our study confirms that the common practice of targeting tuna with day sets and swordfish with night sets is effective. In addition, bluefin tuna and swordfish catches responded to most of the variables we tested in the opposite directions. Bluefin tuna catch was negatively correlated with longitude and the number of light sticks used whereas swordfish catch was positively correlated with these two variables. We argue that overfishing of bluefin tuna can be alleviated and that swordfish can be targeted more efficiently by avoiding fishing in anticyclonic eddies and in near-shore waters and using more light sticks and fishing at night in our study area, although further studies are needed to propose a solid oceanography-based management plan for catch selection. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley},

abstract = {Previous genetic studies of Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius L.) revealed significant differ- entiation among Mediterranean, North Atlantic and South Atlantic populations using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. However, limitations in geographic sampling cover- age, and the use of single loci, precluded an accurate placement of boundaries and of esti- mates of admixture. In this study, we presentmultilocus analyses of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 10 nuclear genes to estimate population differentiation and admixture based on the characterization of 774 individuals representing North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Mediterranean swordfish populations. Pairwise FST values,AMOVA, PCoA, and Bayesian individual assignments support the differentiation of swordfish inhabit- ing these three basins, but not the current placement of the boundaries that separate them. Specifically, the range of the South Atlantic population extends beyond 5°N management boundary to 20°N-25°N from 45°W. Likewise theMediterranean population extends beyond the current management boundary at the Strait of Gibraltar to approximately 10°W. Further, admixture zones, characterized by asymmetric contributions of adjacent populations within samples, are confined to the Northeast Atlantic. While South Atlantic and Mediterranean mi- grants were identified within these Northeast Atlantic admixture zones no North Atlantic mi- grants were identified respectively in these two neighboring basins. Owing to both, the characterization of larger number of loci and a more ample spatial sampling coverage, it was possible to provide a finer resolution of the boundaries separating Atlantic swordfish populations than previous studies. Finally, the patterns of population structure and admix- ture are discussed in the light of the reproductive biology, the known patterns of dispersal, and oceanographic features that may act as barriers to gene flow to Atlantic swordfish.},

Whereas demersal species have been tracked using tide-driven geolocation models, pelagic species which undertake extensive migrations have been mainly tracked using light-based models. Here, we present a new HMM-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields-satellite SST and temperatures derived from the MARS3D hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags (DSTs) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.},

abstract = {Critical gaps in our understanding of the distributions, interactions, life histories and preferred habitats of large and medium-size pelagic fishes severely constrain the implementation of ecosystem-based, spatially structured fisheries management approaches. In particular, spawning distributions and the environmental characteristics associated with the early life stages are poorly documented. In this study, we consider the diversity, assemblages, and associated habitat of the larvae of large and medium-sized pelagic species collected during 2 years of monthly surveys across the Straits of Florida. In total, 36 taxa and 14,295 individuals were collected, with the highest diversity occurring during the summer and in the western, frontal region of the Florida Current. Only a few species (e.g. Thunnus obesus, T. alalunga, Tetrapturus pfluegeri) considered for this study were absent. Small scombrids (e.g. T. atlanticus, Katsuwonus pelamis, Auxis spp.) and gempylids dominated the catch and were orders of magnitude more abundant than many of the rare species (e.g. Thunnus thynnus, Kajikia albida). Both constrained (CCA) and unconstrained (NMDS) multivariate analyses revealed a number of species groupings including: (1) a summer Florida edge assemblage (e.g. Auxis spp., Euthynnus alleterattus, Istiophorus platypterus); (2) a summer offshore assemblage (e.g. Makaira nigricans, T. atlanticus, Ruvettus pretiosus, Lampris guttatus); (3) an ubiquitous assemblage (e.g. K. pelamis, Coryphaena hippurus, Xiphias gladius); and (4) a spring/winter assemblage that was widely dispersed in space (e.g. trachipterids). The primary environmental factors associated with these assemblages were sea-surface temperature (highest in summer-early fall), day length (highest in early summer), thermocline depth (shallowest on the Florida side) and fluorescence (highest on the Florida side). Overall, the results of this study provide insights into how a remarkable diversity of pelagic species spatially and temporally partition spawning within a region that is characterized by dynamic oceanography and strong habitat gradients. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Swordfish is the target species for harpoon fishery in the Central Mediterranean Sea (southern Tyrrhenian Sea and Strait of Messina). This is a seasonal fishing activity, carried out in daylight during the swordfish's reproductive period. The relationship between sea surface temperature (SST), catches, Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) and fish swimming behaviour, recorded by direct observation, was investigated between 1999 and 2008. Data from AVHRR-SST (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-Sea Surface Temperature), the meteorological station and the swordfish daily catch were recorded. A low presence of pairs was observed in the 2003 summer season, corresponding to an anomalous sea surface temperature recorded in the study area. After 2003, an early presence of pairs (in May rather than in June) was recorded. ANOVA and Bonferroni correction showed significant differences of CPUE of pairs between May and June, and June and August (F3=8.07, P0.0001). The relationship between immature and mature adult specimens, single and in pairs, four ranges of SST, seven swimming behaviours and five maturity stages was analysed by the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Fish in pairs were mainly observed at temperatures over 24 degrees C, showing a well-defined courtship behaviour, i.e. a female route. At lower temperatures, the dominant behaviour was basking in immature fish and breaching in mature fish. A significant relationship between SST and fish behaviour was detected in both immature and mature adult specimens},
